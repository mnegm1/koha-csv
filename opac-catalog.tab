292487	1	Climate Change : | A Geoscience Perspective /	St. John, Kristen.	This open access book on climate change assesses past climatic change from a geoscience perspective and directly and effectively addresses common misconceptions on climate and climate change.A geoscience perspective on the multiple causes, rates, and consequences of climate change is essential context to assess modern climate change and our role in it, as well as forecasting future climate conditions. Yet, most textbooks on climate change focus only on the very recent past (e.g., last century), are not sufficiently engaging for non-scientists, or explore paleoclimate science at a level too challenging for introductory students. In addition, a wide range of misconceptions and confusion exists in the general public about climate change. Correcting misconceptions is an essential aspect of education, but educational research has shown that it is challenging to achieve. This textbook includes introductions to each thematic Part, that directly identify relevant misconceptions and refute them with clear, concise messages (i.e., learning goals) that are grounded in science and expanded on in the supporting chapters. Such refutation-style approaches have been shown to be effective at addressing misconceptions.The book offers a clear trajectory of fundamental climate science concepts, which are most beneficially combined to provide a valuable geoscience perspective on the causes, rates, and consequences of climate change. It frames the collection of climate science chapters with impactful, relevant social science context: starting the book with a chapter that explores the reasons behind the disconnect between the scientific and public understanding of climate change, and ending the book with a discussion of the intersection of ethics and climate change. Short topical expansions or excursions are included as "boxes" within selected chapters.This book will serve as a basic resource for learning about the lessons that the paleoclimate record offers to evaluate the seriousness of modern and future climate change.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292487
292486	1	Recycling Institutions : | How Waste Becomes an Urban Mine /	Nogueira, Letícia Antunes.	This open access book investigates the phenomenon of recycling institutions in urban mining using social sciences lenses on the empirical context of waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), landfills as a potential resource pool and the recycling of building materials in Norway.There is a dual meaning to the term 'recycling institutions', and this book has the ambition to explore both. The first refers to institutions that recycle, i.e., the institutional infrastructure that facilitates material recycling. From household attitudes and practices to the laws and regulations that govern waste management, there is an institutional apparatus that recycling relies upon, which gains increased importance as the sustainability agenda develops. The second meaning refers to the recycling of institutions, in the sense that the institutional setup itself is being repurposed and transformed. This more metaphorical meaning points to the way in which emerging societal ambitions (such as the circular economy) stretch and bend existing institutions by imposing new functions upon them. Institutions are conservative and backward-looking and tend to resist rapid and radical changes that are incompatible with the ideas and practices they are built on. So, whereas the first is about designing new institutions for circularity, the second is about modifying and "recycling" existing institutions to meet the challenges circularity may entail.The central premise is that relevant, supportive and well-functioning institutional environments are crucial in the transition to a greener society that encourages industries, businesses, households and citizens to act in more sustainable ways, and it identify both possibilities and obstacles in the emergence of institutions that support urban mining. This book integrates a range of disciplines in the social sciences to investigate the phenomenon of recycling institutions. By examining the case of urban mining in Norway, with a special focus on how existing structures developed for waste management can be repurposed to facilitate this new function, the book provides insight into a scenario where material sourcing from anthropogenic sources is dissociated from natural resource scarcity and is instead linked to political ambitions and an attempt to stay at the forefront of sustainability transitions.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292486
292485	1	International Law after the Ukraine War : | Principles, Challenges, and Future Directions /	Giblin, Jennifer.	Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine was a defining moment for international law and its ability to maintain international peace and security. This book highlights the principles, methods and systems in place to regulate peaceful relations between states, and the implications the war in Ukraine has had on their relevance in the changing geopolitical world.Bringing together leading experts on international law, including key Ukrainian voices, the book explores the strengths and weaknesses in international law which have been exposed by Russia's invasion. The UN has stated that the war has catastrophic effects for international security and human rights. The book explores these statements, drawing on varied aspects of international law to determine lessons to be learned from the Ukraine conflict. It also explores how international law has had to adapt to tackle the challenges which have arisen. The book asks, has the conflict challenged the theory and fundamental values of international law? Have there been any new legal developments, prompted by the war, which could be applied to future conflicts? Through these timely questions, the book re-evaluates the changing landscape of international law.The book will be of interest to students and scholars in the fields of international law, the use of force, humanitarian law, criminal law, refugee law and human rights law.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292485
292484	1	Environmental, Social, and Governance Ratings : | Risks, Regulations, and Market Dynamics /	Chodnicka-Jaworska, Patrycja.	In recent years, the world of finance and investments has changed, considering measures related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors for socially responsible investments. ESG scoring and ratings are used to estimate ESG risk.This book presents ESG ratings and scorings and their providers and lists problems with data quality, data sources, and unknown methodology, contributing to the green- and social-washing ESG rating phenomenon. The value of assets invested in green instruments relies on high-quality ESG ratings to measure green transition. Data greenwashing negatively impacts the financial market, especially the stock price, fund activities, and bond markets. The size of the rated company, geographical location, and industry biases are considered in understanding the greenwashing phenomenon. This book illustrates all the problems related to ESG rating inflation, conflicts of interest, models of payment, and internal and external ratings. It describes current regulations, initiatives, and practical knowledge of ESG scoring.Academics and students of financial law, economics, and financial sustainability will find this book invaluable. The practical implications in the book will benefit sustainability-concerned regulators and practitioners who estimate ESG risk (especially in financial institutions).							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292484
292483	1	Publishing Beyond the Market : | Open Access, Care, and the Commons /	Moore, Samuel A.	Publishing Beyond the Market argues that the move to open access should focus less on the free accessibility of research outputs and more on who controls the publications and infrastructures for scholarly communication. By deploying theoretical literature on science and technology studies, care ethics, and the commons, the book critically interrogates open access and reimagines a more ethical future for researcher-led publishing. A case study of Plan S--the multifunder European policy for open access publishing--explores its tendency to rehearse all the failures of commercialisation. Through critical engagement with the open access landscape, the book reveals the shortcomings of market-centric and policy-based approaches to open access book and journal publishing, particularly their tendency to reinforce conservatism, commercialism, and private control of publishing. Going forward, Publishing Beyond the Market explores the importance of collectivity and democratic governance within the transition to open access publishing. It suggests that developing a commons-based, scholar-led publishing landscape through a series of presses that are each managed by working academics could offer a productive counterpoint to marketised systems of open access and subscription publishing. In weaving themselves together in order to "scale small" these publishing initiatives would act as a counter-hegemonic project based on mutual reliance and care. By illustrating how these projects build toward a commons-based publishing future, and how they may complement other approaches to publishing within university presses and libraries, the book culminates in an argument for the infrastructures, policies, and forms of governance needed to nurture such a collective vision.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292483
292482	1	The Politics of Beginning : | The Origin of Private Authority in the Process of Translation /	Esguerra, Alejandro.	The Politics of Beginning traces the formation of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), now the most authoritative private organization for forestry certification. It starts with recounting the highly politicized forest politics of the late 1980s, when activists protested human rights abuses and deforestation while experimenting with sustainable forestry practices. The book then follows the people who became the founding members of the Forest Stewardship Council. By using live audio recordings of the FSC founding assembly in 1993, this book provides an in-depth analysis of a constitutional moment for private authority in world politics. To explore how timber merchants, Indigenous communities, and social and environmental NGOs engaged in private institution-making, Alejandro Esguerra works with the concept of translation developed in Actor-Network Theory--a process in which knowledge about governance is continuously recontextualized--and introduces it to International Relations theory. He develops a dramaturgical methodology with metaphors of theatre such as stage, script, and performance. This methodology can be used to analyze the ways in which activists and others translate knowledge about governance and the practices of inclusion and exclusion that appear during this process. The environmental crisis requires a transformation in the ways societies value and govern human-nature relations, and The Politics of Beginning reveals the conditions under which even formerly antagonistic actors start developing a common political project.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292482
292481	1	Digital Warfare : | Media and Technologies in the Russo-Ukrainian War /	Zasanska, Nadia.	Digital media and technologies remain unpredictable when we approach them as actors in armed conflicts. Artificial intelligence, drones, information leaks, hacking, propaganda and fakes become part of war reality. The contributors to this volume prompt us to focus on the virtual fronts of the Russo-Ukrainian War, examining the agency of an individual, community and society in the digitalized war reality. This collection illustrates how digital spaces empower society to stay resilient, resist Russias aggression and defend democratic values in times of adversity and severe trials.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292481
292480	1	Revolution and Restoration : | The Politics of Anachronism /	Tomba, Massimiliano.	At a time when terms like restoration, religion, authority, obligations, and natural law--once the rallying cries of the most emancipatory movements--are increasingly coopted by conservative forces, Revolution and Restoration offers a thought-provoking account of how "outdated" concepts can ignite radical energy and collective action. Through both historical and contemporary examples, the book elaborates the concrete possibilities for reimagining politics and society that emerge out of the clash between incompatible legal and economic structures. At its core, Tomba's book confronts the very foundations of the modern state and its three pillars: property, democracy, and citizenship. These pillars, long celebrated in the Western canon, are nevertheless mechanisms of exclusion: property is the denial of communal access, representative democracy the marginalization of the demos from decision-making, and citizenship the exclusion of the foreigner. Revolution and Restoration critiques these pillars to show how new concepts and political possibilities that emerge from political and social conflicts hold the potential to transcend and remake democracies in crisis. Revolution and Restoration: The Politics of Anachronism is available from the Knowledge Unlatched on an open-access basis.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292480
292479	1	Introduction to International Studies /	Berger, Maurits.	International Studies aims to understand the global complexities of the world in which we live today. Central in these complexities is the position of the human individual, who is both an actor and reactor in global events. This textbook introduces three I's - interests, identities, ideas - that provide a framework to understand human behaviour in today's world. The role of people is further elaborated in the three spatial dimensions of the local, regional, and global level. This gives International Studies the character of a 3-D chessboard with human players. Unique in this textbook is the framework of global scopes used for analysis of the global complexities: global structures (such as economics, belief systems, states, intergovernmental organizations), global trends (such as nationalism, power changes, secularization, identity), and global challenges (such as sustainable development, climate change, pandemics, unwanted migration). This textbook approaches International Studies as a field of study that enables students to navigate the framework of the three I's, the three spatial dimensions and the three global scopes. The International Studies student will acquire a broad overview of the various fields and disciplines and, as a consequence, the ability to move across traditional academic boundaries.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292479

292477	1	Under Pressure? : | Living with Climate Change and Environmental Hazards in the Past and Now /	Bradtmöller, Marcel.	This open access book gathers different case studies of resilience and coping strategies in hunter-gatherer societies who were confronted with natural hazards. Joined in this book, authors display a range of strategies how people could face natural hazards and climate change, how they manage stress at a group or personal level, and how they transmit their knowledge about dreadful events and successful responses to later generations. Consequently, this book is primarily for a scientific audience focused on hunter-gatherers but will also provide insights for those interested in human responses to crisis and change.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292477
292476	1	Spatial Methods in Transdisciplinarity for Urban Sustainability : | A Transformative Methodological Spectrum /	Frehse, Fraya.	The book critically addresses the role of spatial methods in a transdisciplinary research-practice agenda regarding the promotion of urban sustainability throughout the globe with the aid of eight different, transdisciplinary approaches primarily based throughout the Global South and jointly penned by academics and practitioners. While the range of methodological discussions regarding research-and-practice collaborations between scientific researchers and local practitioners (based in NGOs, private firms or local government agencies) as well as independent policy-makers or artists for the purpose of urban sustainability has been thriving vastly over the last years, little attention has been paid to spatial methods in particular. This is not to mention their transdisciplinary use in urban contexts of the Global South. Resorting on empirical settings as diverse as Pretoria (South Africa), Porto Alegre and São Paulo (Brazil), Kolkata (India), Bangkok (Thailand) and Tshwane (South Africa) during the last four (partially Covid-19 pandemic) years as well as Tangerang (Indonesia) from 2001 to 2021, and San José (Costa Rica) between 2004 and 2007, the book sheds light on the following, twofold question: Which possibilities and limitations can spatial methods respectively unravel and encounter for transdisciplinary research and practice, in view of the SDG11 targets? By pursuing very diversified research-and-practice paths with the aid of specific combinations of spatial methods, each of the eight chapters makes evident the book's central claim: the deployment of spatial methods in transdisciplinary projects for SDG11 has a transformative role. While some chapters especially highlight the personal dimension of the changes brought about to academics by the spatial-methodological, transdisciplinary experiments, others emphasize the academic reach of the spatial-methodological experience accomplished in and through transdisciplinarity. This is an open access book.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292476
292475	1	Habitable Future : | Smart Spaces, Objects, and Devices to Support Aging /	Ferrante, Tiziana.	This open-access book presents a multidisciplinary approach to the design of living spaces from an age-friendly perspective, in line with the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) paradigm, which promotes the integration of assistive devices and technologies to create safe, comfortable environments that meet the needs of older adults and their caregivers. It outlines new operational strategies, incorporating an analysis of technological development trends focused on the well-being and health of older adults, identifying their needs and expectations through participatory processes, and establishing design requirements to foster the acceptance of interfaces and emerging devices. In light of the exponential increase in smart applications within living environments, the book emphasizes the necessity to introduce cutting-edge solutions for data transmission and processing, as well as the development of semantically driven tools to support designers in selecting and integrating assistive technologies through virtual environment simulations. The book also illustrates the methodological processes adopted in defining guidelines for the design of spaces dedicated to older adults, with attention to architectural and functional aspects in various domains: perceptual and sensory factors for the design of waiting areas in Community Houses, technological and environmental requirements for the integration of devices in home adaptation projects for Home Care and locational and typological criteria for the development of new Social Day Care Centers. These contributions are based on the experiences shared during the conference organized by the WP1 "Human-Centred Design and Evaluation, Certifications, Sustainability within the Built Environment" of Spoke9, within the framework of the Age-It/NRRP program.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292475

292176	1	بوكو حرام : | من الجماعة إلى الولاية، أزمة التطرف و الفساد في أفريقيا /	أحمد، محمد عبد الكريم،	يتناول الكتاب دراسة الحالة النيجيرية بكل تناقضاتها، ويشرح كيف يمكن استغلال هذه الدراسة لفهم واقع الدولة الأفريقية فى مرحلة ما بعد الاستقرار. كما يطرح الكتاب سؤالاً مهما هو: لماذا يعانى الأفارقة من الفقر والبطالة إذا كانت بلدانهم تزخر بالموارد الطبيعية والبشرية الهائلة؟ وبالحديث عن "بوكو حرام"، تلك الجماعة التى تسببت فى الكثير من الحوادث والاعتداءات الخطيرة، يقول الكاتب إن القضاء عليها لن يكون سهلا، أو عن طريق استخدام وسائل مكافحة الإرهاب التقليدية التى تتبعها السلطات النيجيرية، فالتدهور الاقتصادى والسياسى والأمنى الذى تعانى منه البلاد منذ استقلالها عام 1960 أدى إلى حال من السخط انتشرت بين أهالى نيجيريا وتسببت فى نوع من عدم الاستقرار. وهكذا فإنه يمكن النظر إلى "بوكو حرام" على أنها مثال لحالة انعدام الأمن الإنسانى العام التى حلَّت بالبلاد جراء الفساد الذى لطَّخ التاريخ السياسى والاقتصادى لنيجيريا.. ونتيجة لذلك، فإن إجراءات السيطرة التى يتم تطبيقها، إن لم تحصن على المدى الطويل بتنمية اقتصادية وسياسية، يمكن أن تمثل مجرد قدر بسيط فى إصلاح متعجل وغير فعال، وأن تسفر عن ظهور حركات "بوكو حرام" أخرى، تحت تسميات مختلفة. ينقسم الكتاب إلى ثمانية فصول تناقش النقاط التالية؛ الفصل الأول: نيجيريا: عملاق أفريقيا التائه؟ والفصل الثاني: نشأة "بوكو حرام"، والفصل الثالث: تفكيك أيديولوجيا "بوكو حرام": ابن الغير لا يمكن اقتراضه، والفصل الرابع: الإرهاب فى مواجهة دولة الفساد، والفصل الخامس: تمدد "بوكو حرام" الإقليمي... الجريمة والعقاب، والفصل السادس: الغرب و"بوكو حرام"، والفصل السابع: "بوكو حرام"...

292151	2	كلمة سعادة الدكتور خليفة مبارك الظاهري في ندوة العمل معاً لوقف تمويل الإخوان المسلمين في أوروبا /		تبحث هذه الدراسة في واقع جماعة الإخوان المسلمين في أوروبا، مسلطةً الضوء على مخاطرها الأيديولوجية والتنظيمية، ومُركزةً على محورية التمويل كأداة رئيسية لاستدامة نفوذها وتوسيع نطاقها داخل المجتمعات الغربية. تبدأ الدراسة باستعراض الأسس الفكرية الراديكالية للجماعة، القائمة على أيديولوجية إقصائية ترفض التعددية وتسعى إلى بناء ولاءات تتجاوز الدولة القومية. ثم تستعرض تحولات خطاب الإخوان واستخدامهم أساليب براغماتية لكسب الشرعية المجتمعية والسياسية. تُبيّن الدراسة تنوع مصادر تمويل الإخوان، بما في ذلك استخدام الزكاة والأوقاف، وترويج التمويل الإسلامي والصكوك، واستغلال صناعة المنتجات الحلال، وحتى استثمارات العملات المشفرة، وإنشاء شركات وهمية لإخفاء أصول الأموال. كما تبحث الورقة في تأثير هذا التمويل على المجتمعات المسلمة، وخاصةً بين الشباب والمهاجرين من الجيلين الثاني والثالث. وتؤكد الدراسة أيضا على خطورة هذا التمويل، إذ لا يقتصر على دعم أنشطة المناصرة، بل يمتد إلى تمكين الكيانات السياسية التي تعمل على إضعاف الهوية الوطنية، وتعزيز العزلة المجتمعية، وتأجيج الخطاب المتطرف والكراهية. ¦ أبرز ما جاء في مشاركة سعادة الدكتور خليفة الظاهري، مدير الجامعة، في ندوة «العمل معا لوقف تمويل الإخوان المسلمين في أوروبا التي نظمها مركز تريندز للبحوث والاستشارات بالتعاون مع مجلس الشيوخ الفرنسي في باريس :  جماعة الإخوان خطر على المجتمعات والدول مشروعها قائم على التغلغل، والتفرقة، وتغذية الصراعات باسم الدين. الإخوان لا يؤمنون بقيمة المواطنة الحديثة، عندهم الولاء للتنظيم فوق الولاء للوطن، والعنف أداة مشروعة لتحقيق الغايات السياسية. مواجهة تمويل الإخوان ليست حربا على الدين ولا على حرية العبادة، بل هي حماية للمجتمع من اختطاف الدين المشاريع هدامة. التبرعات الخيرية والعملات المشفرة باتت أدوات جديدة لتمويل التنظيمات المتطرفة، ما يجعل فرض سياسات الرقابة المالية على هذه الجماعات أولوية أوروبية مشتركة. إحكام الرقابة على شركات صناعة الحلال والمؤسسات المالية الموازية ضرورة للحد من توظيف العائدات في مشاريع الدعاية والتطرف.  تجريد الإخوان من مواردهم المالية هو الخطوة الأولى لتحرير الجاليات من هيمنتهم، وحماية  مستقبل الأجيال. عندما تجف منابع تمويل الإخوان الإرهابية، يفقدون القدرة على التأثير والتجنيد وإنتاج الرمزية التي يستقطبون بها الشباب لذا فإن تجفيف التمويل خطوة جوهرية لحماية السلم الاجتماعي. احتكار الإخوان للخطاب الديني داخل المساجد وخطب الجمعة يهدد التعايش ويشرعن التطرف مما يجعل تطوير منظومة تدريب وطنية للأئمة ضرورة لا تحتمل التأجيل. تجربة دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة رائدة ومتقدمة صنفت الإخوان تنظيما إرهابيا منذ عام 2014، وتبنت خطابًا دينيا أصيلا قائما على التسامح والولاء للوطن.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292151

292149	2	تنظيم الإخوان المسلمين : | خطاب التطرف و التضليل /		يكشف هذا الكتاب “تنظيم الإخوان المسلمين: خطاب التطرف والتضليل” جذور المشروع الإخواني منذ تأسيسه عام 1928 وحتى امتداداته المعاصرة. يتناول بالدراسة والتحليل خطاب الجماعة الذي حوَّل الإسلام من رسالة إنسانية وأخلاقية إلى مشروع سياسي سلطوي مغلق قائم على الحاكمية، والتكفير، واستباحة العنف. يعرض الكتاب كيف أسهمت الجماعة في تقويض الدولة الوطنية وإضعاف مفهوم المواطنة، وكيف استثمرت الأزمات لنشر خطاب المظلومية والهيمنة، ممهّدة الطريق أمام التنظيمات الإرهابية مثل القاعدة وداعش. ويبرز الكتاب الدور الريادي لدولة الإمارات في مواجهة هذا الفكر المتطرف عبر التشريعات، والمؤسسات الدينية المعتدلة، والمبادرات الفكرية والإنسانية، مثل “وثيقة الأخوة الإنسانية”. كما يقدّم مساهمات نخبة من المفكرين والعلماء الذين فصّلوا في خطورة المشروع الإخواني على الدين والمجتمع والدولة، مؤكدين أن الإسلام دين محبة ورحمة وعدل، لا أداة للهيمنة والصراع، وأن الوطن ليس خصمًا للعقيدة، بل هو الحاضن للدين على أرضه تُقام الشعائر، وتُعلَّم فيه القيم والأخلاق، وتُحفظ فيه الأنفس والأسر والمال والعقول. يمثل هذا الكتاب جرس إنذار ودعوة للتأمل، إذ يضع القارئ أمام مسؤولية حماية الدين من التسييس، وصون الأوطان من الانقسام، وترسيخ قيم الرحمة والعقل والسلام. وهو مرجع لكل من يسعى لفهم جذور الفكر المتطرف وسبل مواجهته ببصيرة معرفية ورؤية إنسانية.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292149

292132	2	Deconstructing the discourse of religious extremism: | the UAE experience /	AlDhaheri, Khalifa Mubarak,	This study seeks to dismantle the false claims of terrorist groups that falsely attribute their actions to Islam. It exposes the distortion of Islamic teachings these groups rely on to justify acts explicitly condemned in the Qur'an and Prophetic Sunna-acts considered grave sins with clear rulings that admit no alternative interpretation. The study traces the historical emergence and development of prominent terrorist organizations, highlighting their ideological deviations and notorious crimes. It then offers a rigorous academic and rational refutation, grounded in authentic Islamic texts, demonstrating that Islam fundamentally promotes tolerance, peaceful coexistence, and respect for others. Far from advocating violence, Islam urges the avoidance of war and harm. The study concludes by showcasing national initiatives that have effectively countered extremism through educational, cultural, and security efforts, achieving significant support at both the popular and governmental levels. These initiatives represent practical responses to the threat of terrorism while reaffirming Islam's message of peace.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292132

292029	1	Capitalism Reloaded : | The Rise of the Authoritarian-Financial Complex /	Bloom, Peter,	In Capitalism Reloaded, Peter Bloom charts a pivotal shift from the well-known military-industrial complex to a new 'Authoritarian-Financial Complex'. Unlike its predecessor, which centred on armaments and defence, this emerging power structure fuses financial interests with advanced surveillance and digital control, turning social repression into a lucrative industry. Bloom introduces a ground breaking theory of 'complex power', where control itself becomes a central driver of capitalism, shaping economies and societies. Bloom explores how this insatiable demand for security and profit extends beyond traditional authoritarian regimes, permeating everyday life and eroding democratic freedoms. This book challenges readers to confront the deep entanglements of modern capitalism before they solidify into a techno-authoritarian order.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292029
292028	1	The Realities of Autonomous Weapons /	Bächle, Thomas Christian,	The realities of autonomous weapons are a complex blend of both existing military technologies and visions of their future capabilities. The expected ramifications are profound and always point to the interplay between fact and fiction, actual developments and creative imagination. This book explores how these realities shape and become themselves shaped by popular culture, regulatory and ethics debates, military doctrines, policies and research. It examines phenomena ranging from film and artistic interpretations to warfare scenarios and weaponized artificial intelligence. Intended for researchers (including the disciplines of political and social sciences, media, culture and technology), policy makers, educators and journalists, this is a key resource that uncovers how autonomous weapons are constructed as both a technological reality and a futuristic possibility.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292028

292026	1	Children and violence : | agency, experience, and representation in and beyond armed conflict /		This multi- disciplinary volume provides an innovative approach to children and violence, looking beyond the existing literature that focuses on child soldiers in the 'Global South.' Harnessing expert contributions from over a dozen countries, the book examines the relationship between children and violence, with a focus on children ensnared in military conflict, embroiled in criminal gangs, and enmeshed in political activism. It analyses how children join fights, how they fight, and what happens to them after fighting officially ends. It addresses cutting- edge issues such as cyberwars, self-defence, intergenerational trauma, gender fluidity, racism and state surveillance. Throughout, the book underscores the need to respect the agency and dignity of children and youth, to build cultures of juvenile rights, and to think critically of the place of the child amid global power politics and decolonisation. Through accessible writing, and the provision of considerable new data, this book supports advocacy work and will enrich teaching and spark further academic research. This book will be of great interest to students of International Law, Human Rights, Childhood Studies, International Relations, Peace and Conflict Studies, Post- Conflict Studies, and Security Studies.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292026

This new, edited book volume seeks to explore the many ways in which Quebec engages with the United States, including political exchange, border issues, trade, business and investment, transportation, immigration, cultural links and identity, the role of energy transmission and natural resources, and environmental considerations. As a sub-national actor pursuing a wide range of paradiplomatic bilateral and multilateral initiatives directly involving the U.S., our book both explores and explains what, when, why and how Québec has chosen to engage the United States while examining the fundamental issues that lie at the heart of the relationship. Multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary in focus, this edited collection of essays, titled The Québec-United States Relationship: Political, Security, Economic, Environmental and Cultural Dynamics, features the work of scholars who think deeply about Quebec-U.S. relations. Each contribution considers contemporary policy relevant issues; in so doing, this collection examines and emphasizes the background, scope, and impacts of policy decisions.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292024
292023	1	The Brazilian Amazonia in Change II : | Five Decades of Exploitation, Deforestation and Attempts at Sustainable Development /	Kohlhepp, Gerd,	In the Brazilian planning region Amazônia Legal, deforestation of rain forests for the extraction of mineral resources, cattle breeding, soybean farming, transport infrastructure and hydropower plants was carried out without regard for the indigenous people and regional socio-ecological vulnerability. The implementation of damaging mega-programmes caused disastrous environmental problems. Large-scale destruction of biodiversity, rising temperatures and instability of precipitation not only pose a threat to the region, but also have global impacts on climate change. Over the last two decades, parts of Amazônia Legal have evolved from a CO2 sink to a source of CO2 emissions.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292023
292022	1	Violent Impacts : | How Power and Inequality Shape the Concussion Crisis /	Henne, Kathryn,	A free ebook version of this title is available through Luminos, University of California Press's Open Access publishing program. Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more. Concerns regarding brain injury in sport have escalated into what is often termed a "concussion crisis," fueled by high-profile lawsuits and deaths. Although athletes are central figures in this narrative, they comprise only a small proportion of the people who experience brain injuries, while other high-risk groups--including victims of domestic violence and police brutality--are all too often left out of the story. In Violent Impacts, Kathryn Henne and Matt Ventresca examine what is and what isn't captured in popular discourse, scrutinizing how law, science, and social inequalities shape depictions and understandings of brain injury. Drawing on research carried out in Australia, Canada, and the United States, they illustrate how structural violence centers certain bodies as part of the concussion crisis while pushing others to the margins.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292022
292021	1	From Kosovo to Darfur : | The Regional Biases Within Humanitarian Military Interventionism /	Kushi, Sidita,	Why are some violent crises more likely to prompt humanitarian military interventions than others? Conventional wisdom says that humanitarian military interventions occur due to national interests, shared values and norms, or economic benefits for the interveners. Yet neither of these factors can fully explain the selectivity of such interventions. The international community continues to ignore the decades-long suffering in Darfur, often dismisses the genocidal policies within Myanmar, and even perpetuates the suffering in contemporary Yemen, while undertaking humanitarian-laden missions in Libya, Syria, and the Balkans. Using in-depth case studies and new data on all post-Cold War internal armed conflicts matched to third-party responses, From Kosovo to Darfur offers the first regionally sensitive analysis of humanitarian military intervention since the end of the Cold War. It shows that international military interventions in the context of acute humanitarian crises are driven by different pathways within the Western versus the non-Western world and fueled by elite perceptions of the crisis, making interventions closer to the geographic and cultural West most probable and most intense. As our international community becomes increasingly interdependent and aware of human suffering across borders, From Kosovo to Darfur points to new pathways of conflict trajectories and reveals vital implications for leaders, scholars, and nongovernmental actors advocating for or against international military intervention as a policy choice.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292021

292019	1	Families Affected by Addiction : | A Handbook /		This Open Access book sheds new light on the wide range of Affected Family Members' experiences. At a conservative estimate, there are at least 100 million adults across the globe who are affected by their relatives' addiction problems. These Affected Family Members (AFMs) experience multiple stresses, coping dilemmas, and a lack of information and support, and are at heightened risk for ill-health. The results are very costly, both from the personal and from the public services point of view. The volume elaborates on the barriers to providing effective help, including political neglect, under-representation in both policy and service delivery models, the lack of involvement and encouragement from health and social care professionals, the stigmatisation and bias as barriers to care, and the range of evidence-based interventions. It also explores the similarities and differences of all of these areas depending on the type of addiction problem that the family is affected by - alcohol, illicit drugs, gambling, etc. While covering the more commonly reported work in high-income countries, the contributions put strong emphasis on the experience of AFMs in low- and middle-income countries.

292015	1	Fear the Future : | Dystopia and Political Imagination in the Twentieth Century /	Cole, Matthew Benjamin,	After centuries of contemplating utopias, late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century writers began to warn of dystopian futures. Yet these fears extended beyond the canonical texts of dystopian fiction into postwar discourses on totalitarianism, mass society, and technology, as well as subsequent political theories of freedom and domination. Fear the Future demonstrates the centrality of dystopian thinking to twentieth century political thought, showing the pervasiveness of dystopian images, themes, and anxieties. Offering a novel reading of major themes and thinkers, Fear the Future explores visions of the future from literary figures such as Yevgeny Zamyatin, Aldous Huxley, and George Orwell; political theorists such as Max Weber, Hannah Arendt, Herbert Marcuse, Jürgen Habermas, and Michel Foucault; and mid-century social scientists such as Erich Fromm, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, David Reisman, C. Wright Mills, and Jacques Ellul. It offers a comparative analysis of distinct intellectual and literary traditions, including modern utopianism and anti-utopianism, midcentury social science, Frankfurt School critical theory, and continental political philosophy. With detailed case studies of key thinkers from the Enlightenment to the late twentieth century, the book synthesizes secondary literature and research from a range of disciplinary areas, including in political theory, intellectual history, literary studies, and utopian studies. This wide-ranging reconstruction shows that while dystopian thinking has illustrated the dangers of domination and dehumanization, it has also illuminated new possibilities for freedom.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292015
292014	1	Automated Detection of Media Bias : | From the Conceptualization of Media Bias to Its Computational Classification /	Spinde, Timo,	This Open Access book explores the automated identification of media bias, particularly focusing on bias by word choice in digital media. The increasing prevalence of digital information presents opportunities and challenges for analyzing language, with cultural, geographic, and contextual factors shaping how content is portrayed. Despite the interdisciplinary nature of media bias research across fields like linguistics, psychology, and computer science, existing work often tackles the problem from limited perspectives, lacking comprehensive frameworks and reliable datasets. The book aims to advance the field by addressing these gaps and proposing a systematic approach to media bias detection. It develops feature-based and deep-learning approaches for automated bias detection, including a BERT-based model and MAGPIE, a multi-task learning model. These methods demonstrate improved performance on established benchmarks, showcasing the potential of deep learning in detecting media bias. Finally, the author addresses the practical applications of automated bias detection, such as enhancing news reading with forewarning messages, text annotations, and political classifiers, and examines the impact of bias on social media engagement.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292014
292013	1	Brain Fingerprint Identification /	Kong, Wanzeng,	This open access book delves into the emerging field of biometric identification using brainwave patterns. Specifically, this book presents recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG)-based biometric recognition to identify unique neural signatures that can be used for secure authentication and identification Traditional biometric systems such as fingerprints, iris scans, and face recognition have become integral to security and identification. However, these methods are increasingly vulnerable to spoofing and other forms of attack. Unlike other traditional biometrics, EEG signals are non-invasive, continuous authentication, liveness detection, and resistance to coercion due to the complexity and uniqueness of brain patterns. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for high-security fields such as military and finance, providing a promising alternative for future high-security identification and authentication However, most of the existing brain fingerprint identification studies require subjects to perform specific cognitive tasks, which limits the popularization and application of brain fingerprint identification in practical scenarios. Additionally, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and time-varying characteristics of EEG signals, there are distribution differences in EEG data across sessions from several days, leading to stability issues in brain fingerprint features extracted at different sessions. Finally, because the EEG signal is affected by the coupling of multiple factors and the nervous system has continuous spontaneous variability, which makes it difficult for the brain fingerprint identification model to be suitable for the scenarios of unseen sessions and cognitive tasks, and there is the problem of insufficient model generalization. In this book, based on traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods, the authors will carry out multi-task single-session, single-task multi-session, and multi-task multi-session brain fingerprint identification research respectively for the above problems, to provide an effective solution for the application of brain fingerprint identification in practical scenarios.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=292013

291510	1	Drones and US Grand Strategy in the Contemporary World /	Okpaleke, Francis N., ¦ author.	This book makes a compelling case that lethal drone deployment as a counterterrorism tool and instrument of statecraft in targeted states engenders far-reaching consequences for US grand strategy.

The book provides a powerful base of evidence for policy makers and researchers by pointing to the perils of deployment of drone technology beyond their immediate or short-term objectives. It also explores how non-state actors and authoritarian regimes such as armed groups are harnessing armed drone technologies for their own political and military ends, as well as the underlying implications for US grand strategy and international security at large.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291510
291509	1	Landing the Paris Climate Agreement : | How It Happened, Why It Matters, and What Comes Next /	Stern, Todd, ¦ author.	The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change was one of the most difficult and hopeful achievements of the twenty-first century: 195 nations finally agreed, after 20 years of trying, to establish an ambitious, operational regime to address one of the greatest civilizational challenges of our time. In Landing the Paris Climate Agreement, Todd Stern, the chief US negotiator on climate change, provides an engaging account from inside the rooms where it happened: the full, charged, seven-year story of how the Paris Agreement came to be, following an arc from Copenhagen, to Durban, to the secret U.S.-China climate deal in 2014, to Paris itself. With a storyteller's gift for character, suspense, and detail, Stern crafts a high-stakes narrative that illuminates the strategy, policy, politics, and diplomacy that made Paris possible. Introducing readers to a vivid cast of characters, including Xie Zhenhua, Vice Minister of China's National Development and Reform Commission, Bo Lidegaard, chief strategist for Denmark's Prime Minster, and Indian minister Jairam Ramesh, Stern, who worked alongside President Barack Obama and Secretaries of State John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, depicts the pitfalls and challenges overcome, the shifting alliances, the last-minute maneuvering, and the ultimate historic success. The book concludes with a final chapter that describes key developments since 2015 and the author's reflections on what needs to be done going forward to contain the climate threat. A unique peek behind the curtain of one of the most important international agreements of our time, Landing the Paris Climate Agreement is a vital and fascinating read for anyone who cares about the future of our one shared home.    ek behind the curtain of one of the most important international agreements of our time, Landing the Paris Climate Agreement is a vital and fascinating read for anyone who cares about the future of our one shared home.t for Denmark's Prime Minster, and Indian minister Jairam Ramesh, Stern, who worked alongside President Barack Obama and Secretaries of State John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, depicts the pitfalls and challenges overcome, the shifting alliances, the last-minute maneuvering, and the ultimate historic success.

291507	1	Cyberdemocracy : | Transforming Politics /	Karem, Harem, ¦ author.	This book is explicitly modernist at a time when many scholars have either forgotten the emancipatory promise of the Enlightenment or railed against it in the name of postmodernism. The book, broadly, adopts a hybrid epistemology that utilises the critical insights of Geisteswissenschaften Tradition (Weberian 'Ideal-Type Analysis') and the Habermas (1988) notions of the 'public sphere' and deliberative/dialogic democracy ('ideal speech') to advance a general proposition of democratic renewal by way of cyberdemocracy. Curiously, as democracy spreads across the world in the age of globalisation, it has also been accompanied by increased discontent with democratic systems. To that end, this book is not overly concerned with saving democracy beyond the liberal representative model, rather the focus is on how modern representative democracy has failed and how cyberdemocracy might function as a more effective model that truly represents the people by broadening participation and reflexivedeliberation.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291507

291505	1	Circular Economy Applications in Energy Policy /		The circular economy is an economic and industrial model that aims to keep products, their components and materials in circulation for as long as possible, while ensuring the quality of their use. This model is opposed to the linear economy, which is based on the following pattern: extraction or harvesting of resources, manufacture and assembly of goods, distribution and use, and, finally, production of waste. Solar energy, wind power, marine and hydroelectric power, biomass and biofuels are all renewable energy sources. Energy markets alone cannot achieve the desired level of renewable energies worldwide. The main principles of the renewable energy policy include diversifying the world's energy supply, promoting the development of local energy supplies to ensure security of provision, and minimizing energy dependency							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291505

291487	1	Political automation : | an introduction to AI in government and its impact on citizens /	Albrecht, Eduardo,	Governments now routinely use AI-based software to gather information about citizens and determine the level of privacy a person can enjoy, how far they can travel, what public benefits they may receive, and what they can and cannot say publicly. What input do citizens have in how these machines think? In Political Automation, Eduardo Albrecht explores this question in various domains, including policing, national security, and international peacekeeping. Drawing upon interviews with rights activists, Albrecht examines popular attempts to interact with this novel form of algorithmic governance so far. He then proposes the idea of a Third House, a virtual chamber that legislates exclusively on AI in government decision-making and is based on principles of direct democracy, unlike existing upper and lower houses that are representative. Digital citizens, AI powered replicas of ourselves, would act as our personal emissaries to this Third House. An in-depth look at how political automation impacts the lives of citizens, this book addresses the challenges at the heart of automation in public policy decision-making and offers a way forward.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291487

291484	1	Statecraft 2.0 : | what America needs to survive in a multipolar world /	Ross, Dennis,	In a world that is multipolar and America has less relative power, the United States no longer has the luxury to practice statecraft badly. The United States may still be the world's strongest country, but it now faces real challenges at both a global and regional level. The unipolar world which was dominated by America after the Cold War is gone. Unlike the Soviet Union, China is both a military and economic competitor and it is actively challenging the norms and institutions that the US used to shape an international order during and after the Cold War. Directly and indirectly, it has partners trying to undo the American-dominated order, with Russia seeking to extinguish Ukraine, and Iran trying to undermine American presence, influence, and any set of rules for the Middle East that it does not dominate. The failures of American policy in Afghanistan and Iraq have weakened the domestic consensus for a US leadership role internationally. Traditions in US foreign policy, especially the American sense of exceptionalism, have at different points justified both withdrawal and international activism. Iraq and Afghanistan fed the instinct to withdraw and to end the "forever wars." But the folly of these US interventions did not necessarily mean that all use of force to back diplomacy or specific political ends was wrong; rather it meant in these cases, the Bush Administration failed in the most basic task of good statecraft: namely, marrying objectives and means. Nothing more clearly defines effective statecraft than identifying well-considered goals and then knowing how to use all the tools of statecraft--diplomatic, economic, military, intelligence, information, cyber, scientific, education--to achieve them. But all too often American presidents have adopted goals that were poorly defined and not thought through. In Statecraft 2.0, Dennis Ross explains why failing to marry objectives and means has happened so often in American foreign policy. He uses historical examples to illustrate the factors that account for this, including political pressures, weak understanding of the countries where the US has intervened, changing objectives before achieving those that have been established, relying too much on ourselves and too little on allies and partners. To be fair, there have not only been failures, there have been successes as well. Ross uses case studies to look more closely at the circumstances in which Administrations have succeeded and failed in marrying objectives and means. He distills the lessons from good cases of statecraft--German unification in NATO, the first Gulf War, the surge in Iraq 2007-8--and bad cases of statecraft--going to war in Iraq 2003, and the Obama policy toward Syria. Based on those lessons, he develops a framework for applying today a statecraft approach to our policy toward China, Iran, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The book concludes with how a smart statecraft approach would shape policy toward the new national security challenges of climate, pandemics, and cyber.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291484

291466	1	United Nations Peacekeeping and the Politics of Authoritarianism /	Von Billerbeck, Sarah,	Why do countries hosting UN peacekeeping operations tend to consolidate authoritarian forms of governance, despite the UN's own stated aim of promoting democratization? This book advances a theoretically innovative and empirically rich answer to this question: while the UN does not intentionally promote authoritarianism, it faces a number of constraints and dilemmas that give rise to what we call authoritarian enabling. Enabling can occur through two mechanisms, capacity building and the creation of a permissive environment, which enhance the ability of host governments to engage in authoritarian behavior and signal to them that doing so is low-cost. We illustrate these two mechanisms with four in-depth case studies of UN peacekeeping operations: UNTAC in Cambodia, Monuc/Monusco in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Minustah in Haiti, and UNMIL in Liberia. While enabling stops short of the outright promotion of authoritarianism, it explains why the UN's activities often appear to contradict its stated objectives and the outcomes it delivers fall short of its goals. In addition to its theoretical and empirical contributions, the book suggests how these dilemmas and challenges can be overcome							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291466
291465	1	The Oxford Handbook of International Political Economy /	Pevehouse, Jon C.,	The field of International Political Economy (IPE) has rapidly developed into a central pillar in the study of International Relations, and its interdisciplinary roots make it a rich and productive area of scholarly interest. This Oxford Handbook analyses and evaluates the state of the art in IPE research. Bringing together leading experts from a wide geographical and theoretical spectrum, the Handbook provides accessible and comprehensive surveys on topics central to the study of International Political Economy. As IPE scholarship evolves to explore global events such as financial crises and trade wars, examining how politics is both a cause and a consequence of economics, it highlights the practical and problem-driven nature of the field. The Handbook considers the purported European-North American divide and the impact of the surrounding debate on the approach taken to the field. The chapters review the scholarly literature, outline future research opportunities, and consider the ways in which world events have contributed to new research in the field. The Handbook covers both the theoretical and methodological foundations of the field as well as substantive topics within it, including regulation, foreign aid, migration, NGOs, capital, political-military relations, and many others.The Oxford Handbooks of International Relations is a twelve-volume set of reference books offering authoritative and innovative engagements with the principal sub-fields of International Relations.The series as a whole is under the General Editorship of Christian Reus-Smit of the University of Melbourne and Duncan Snidal of the University of Oxford, with each volume edited by specialists in the field. The series both surveys the broad terrain of International Relations scholarship and reshapes it, pushing each sub-field in challenging new directions. Following the example of Reus-Smit and Snidal's original Oxford Handbook of International Relations, each volume is organized around a strong central thematic by scholars drawn from different perspectives, reading its sub-field in an entirely new way, and pushing scholarship in challenging new directions.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291465
291464	1	False : | How Mistrust, Disinformation, and Motivated Reasoning Make Us Believe Things That Aren't True /	Pierre, Joe,	An illuminating exploration of the psychology of false belief that lies at the root of science denialism, political polarization, and rampant belief in misinformation and disinformation. Microchips in our vaccines, stolen elections, climate change denial--in the face of a bewildering range of misbeliefs that stem from mistrust of informational sources, exposure to misinformation and disinformation, and partisan polarization, it's easy to dismiss those who disagree with us as "delusional", "psychotic", or merely "ignorant". But what if none of these judgments are supported by how we really come to believe things, and the truth is that we are all prone to false beliefs? What can we do to protect ourselves in this post-truth world? Drawing on decades of experience as a psychiatrist and clinical professor, Joe Pierre invites readers to journey with him through the normal quirks of brain functioning--such as "heuristics", cognitive biases, motivated reasoning, cognitive dissonance, and bullshit receptivity--that create the cognitive vulnerabilities to false belief innate within us all. With a cross-disciplinary approach, False illuminates the psychology of false belief that lies at the root of contemporary media mistrust, science denialism, and political polarization, and highlights that contrary to popular opinion, deficits of intelligence and mental health are usually not to blame. With a refreshingly unbiased lens, Pierre suggests an antidote to false beliefs and makes the case for softening our convictions, viewing our ideological opponents with compassion, and mending the rifts in our relationships as individuals and societies alike.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291464

291453	1	Energy resource conflict : | origins and global impact /	Parafiniuk, Adrah N.,	Energy resource conflicts have shaped the world we live in. After humans settled across the planet, growing empires began to compete for resources. First, they competed for wood, then steel and coal. The ability to mine these resources and turn them into trains, ships, and weapons decided which countries would dominate the world. Oil became the most important international resource by the turn of the 20th century and has remained so until the present day. This book provides a comprehensive history of international conflicts over energy resources, including ancient empires, 20th-century wars over oil, and the explosive growth of renewable energy. This volume demonstrates that humans have the technology to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy for the vast majority of their energy needs, despite corporate fossil fuel interests. Using advanced statistics on the use and growth of all major energy sources, this book is an excellent source of information on the predicted growth of various forms of energy as well as the inevitable transition toward renewable and carbon-free energy sources							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291453

291442	1	The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Defence /	Taddeo, Mariarosaria,	The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for national defence poses important ethical problems that combine ethical risks related to the use of AI--e.g. enabling human wrongdoing; reducing human control; removing human responsibility; devaluing human skills; and eroding human self-determination--with those that follow the use of force in warfare, like respecting of human dignity and the risk of breaching the principles of Just War Theory. Because of the range of possible applications and of the set of ethical risks and opportunities to address, it is difficult to develop a coherent and systemic ethical analysis of AI in defence. The goal of this chapter is to clarify how this book will do so, by outlining the methodology and the scope of the analysis proposed here. Three aspects are crucial to this end: the definition of AI; the methodology of levels of abstraction; and the identification of three categories of use of AI in defence, namely, sustainment and support, adversarial and non-kinetic, and adversarial and kinetic.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291442

291437	1	Ecosocialism : | climate change, socialism and democracy /	Magnette, Paul,	Ecosocialism: Climate Change, Socialism and Democracy maps out a political path for green transition which is both desirable and practicable - without avoiding its difficulties - giving the fight for climate justice real mobilising power. The author analyses how capitalism prevents climate transition, assessing in detail why the climate cause is not more widely embraced by the working classes, when they are infinitely less responsible and suffer far more from the effects of environmental degradation than their wealthier counterparts. He argues that, faced with the supporters of green capitalism, who promise us that we will be able to continue current lifestyles unhindered - thanks to new technologies - the left seems disarmed. Globally, we face an immense challenge: in the span of one generation, we must decarbonise our planet by 2050. We must make huge changes - but a successful transition could bring huge benefits. This book tackles the root cause of the problem: inequalities and the hyper-concentration of wealth, which are driving forces behind the continued increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity. Denouncing the liberal mythologies of "green growth" and "decoupling", the author frames climate justice as an authentic social struggle, uniting the underclasses of the world, and arguing for the need to develop essential communal services, to put an end to insecurity and protect the planet. The intention is that a full life and sustainable environment are no longer the privilege of a few but the reality of all. This book will appeal to students and scholars of political science and environment and sustainability - as well as all those concerned with climate justice and the current ecological crisis.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291437
291436	1	Beyond States : | Powers, Peoples and Global Order /	Pagden, Anthony,	Today, the majority of the peoples of the planet live in nation-states, based upon the idea, if never the reality, of a single people, a single culture, a single rule of law and a single source of sovereign authority. But will they continue to do so in the future? None of the major challenges that confront humanity today - from climate change to disease, from terrorism to mass migration - can be handled effectively by single nation-states, no matter how powerful. The world is no longer made up only of states but also of an ever-increasing multitude of interstate networks and organizations which recognize no borders. We are beginning to be able to imagine the very real possibility of a new global civil society. But what political form should this take? By examining the history of the evolution of human society from the world's first empires to today's world of interstate networks, this book argues that there now exists the possibility of the emergence of a new political form, a global 'federation of federations', that will bring the species closer to the possibility of a more harmonious, equitable and secure future.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291436
291415	2	Children of the seven sands : | the history of the United Arab Emirates /	McNabb, Alexander.,	The Emirates was founded a little over fifty years ago, by a handshake between two men meeting in a tent in the desert between Abu Dhabi and Dubai – and yet its human history stretches back to the emergence of anatomically modern humans from Africa to populate the earth, a story of 130,000 years of humankind’s survival in one of the world’s harshest environments.  Thanks to modern archaeological and historical research, we can now trace the UAE’s story back to the Garden of Eden, the mythical floods of the Old Testament and the very foundation of the Sumerian civilisation. Known to the Sumerians as Magan, a key source of the copper that sparked the metallurgical revolution that swept Europe, the land of the Emirates was home to a Bronze Age trading entrepot linking Mesopotamia, Persia and the Indus Valley Harappan civilisation. This early Bronze Age human development was transformed through the Iron Age into a locus for agricultural and social innovation, welcoming strange religions and seeing great pre-Islamic cities blossom in the sands, from Mleiha in Sharjah’s desert interior through to Ed-Dur on the coast of Umm Al Quwain. Emerging from the pre-Islamic age to become a commercial centre that dominated the fabulous wealth of the trade monopoly between Asia and Europe, the people of the Emirates would straddle the seven seas until the arrival of the bloody Portuguese triggered the series of clashes with expansionist European empires that would eventually impose the Pax Britannica on the Trucial States, the coastal city states which eventually came together to found the United Arab Emirates when the British protectorate finally ceased in December 1971. This, then, is their story – told in full for the first time ever.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291415

291350	1	Beyond Inhumanity : | Collective Healing, Social Justice and Global Flourishing /	Gill, Scherto,	Collective efforts to address the legacies of slavery and colonialism tend to orient solely towards dealing with material compensation, such as reducing economic disparity, and levelling access to public services. However, communities directly impacted by the dehumanizing legacies have insisted on a broader reckoning--one that recognizes all dimensions of the harms, including the spiritual injury and the relevant psychosocial trauma inflicted across the generations. They remind us that harms of structural injustice extend beyond the material, the physical and the psychological, also entangling the moral, relational, and spiritual fabric of human life. Understanding harms of inhumanity brings to light the layers of damage and is key to identifying interdisciplinary approaches to collective healing, social transformation and the well-being of all. This book emerges from the ongoing intellectual dialogue as part of the UNESCO Collective Healing Initiative. The Initiative focuses on healing the wounds of inhumanity, co-creating just societies and enhancing the flourishing of current and future generations.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291350

291306	1	Leadership as stewardship : | honouring our past while ensuring our future /	Iszatt-White, Marian,	Exploring different understandings of stewardship across a range of research domains and cultures, this insightful book examines the tensions between competing perspectives and their implications for leadership. Marian Iszatt-White proposes 'leadership-as-stewardship' as a new signifier for leadership research, providing practical guidance to leaders navigating the challenges and trade-offs of the Anthropocene. Leadership as Stewardship identifies how the apparent inadequacy of modern leadership coincides with a shift in scholarship away from practical inquiry and towards a range of aspirational approaches, including authentic, sustainable, responsible and ethical. Iszatt-White proposes stewardship as an alternative to these aspirational forms of leadership and challenges the ability of Western, Enlightenment-based thinking to solve global issues created by that same thinking. The book concludes that it is time to place the more enact-able construct of stewardship at the heart of leadership aspirations and scholarly activities. Interdisciplinary in scope, this book will be vital for scholars of leadership, management and organization studies. Highlighting the ability of stewardship to combat perceived failings in leadership as both a construct and a practice, it is also valuable to policymakers, management educators and leadership practitioners.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291306
291304	1	Legal reform in the contemporary socialist world /	Bui, Ngoc Son,	Legal Reform in the Contemporary Socialist World explores four decades of legal reform in the socialist countries of China, Vietnam, Laos, North Korea, and Cuba from a comparative perspective. Spanning the late 1970s to the present, it examines various projects, methods, strategies, contents, driving forces, and limitations of legislative reform, administrative reform, judicial reform, and reform of the legal profession. Legal reform in these countries is the project of the political elite to improve the legal system while retaining its core socialist principles. It is carried out through legislative enactments, amendments, and replacements, which the political elite adopt using incremental strategies to reform the legal system sporadically or systematically. Socialist legal reform is animated by the political aspiration to create the rule of law, the impact of social-economic change, and the influence of transnational and comparative law. Despite significant reforms, the socialist principles of the legal systems in these countries largely remain intact. This legal reform, however, varies considerably by country. Legal Reform in the Contemporary Socialist World offers a holistic view of understudied jurisdictions in comparative law, essential for anyone studying or working in these areas in law, politics, or policy.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291304

291299	1	Hacking hybrid media : | power and practice in an age of manipulation /	Barnard, Stephen R.,	The contemporary public sphere is rife with problematic information, but on what terms are manipulators able to garner attention in the hybrid media system? In Hacking Hybrid Media, Stephen R. Barnard examines how networked media capital is changing the fields of politics and journalism. With a focus on the messaging strategies employed by Donald Trump and his most vocal online supporters, Barnard provides a theoretically oriented and empirically grounded analysis of the ways today's media afford deceptive political communication. Analyzing data from prominent political events, Barnard shows how members of Trump's "digital army" use Facebook groups, Reddit forums, Twitter hashtags, YouTube channels, mass media, and more to shape the flow of disinformation in American media.From the structures of social media platforms to the practices of political actors, Barnard offers a critical appraisal of media power and the capital required to wield it. He reflects not only on the tools and techniques of manipulative media campaigns, but also on the implications they hold for the future of journalism, politics, and democracy in the US and beyond. In striking a balance between social theory and empirical research, Hacking Hybrid Media shows how the emergent structures and practices of the contemporary media system shape how information flows, how meaning is made, and ultimately, how networked social influence works.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291299
291298	1	Axis of resistance : | asymmetric deterrence and rules of the game in contemporary Middle East conflicts /	Sobelman, Daniel,	From the conflict between the United States and the Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria to the recent Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, events in today's Middle East reflect the emergence of what has come to be known as an Iran-led "axis of resistance." A geopolitical network of state- and nonstate actors seeking to promote a new regional order, the "axis" primarily includes the Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Yemen's Houthi rebels, Syria, and multiple Iran-supported Shiite militias in Iraq. Drawing on qualitative in-depth research in Hebrew and Arabic, and on exclusive interviews with senior Israeli officials, Axis of Resistance offers the first comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the "axis" and its application of a distinct strategic approach to asymmetrical conflicts-that of "resistance." Author Daniel Sobelman shows that the various "resistance" forces in the region have pursued an analogous asymmetrical deterrent strategy whose origins trace back to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict in southern Lebanon, whereby the weaker actor attempts to subject the stronger state to limiting "rules of the game."							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291298
291297	1	Sustainability : | transformation, governance, ethics, law /	Ekardt, Felix,	This book proposes a holistic transdisciplinary approach to sustainability as a subject of social sciences. At the same time, this approach shows new ways, as perspectives of philosophy, political science, law, economics, sociology, cultural studies and others are here no longer regarded separately. Instead, integrated perspectives on the key issues are carved out: Perspectives on conditions of transformation to sustainability, on key instruments and the normative questions. This allows for a concise answer to urgent and controversial questions such as the following: Is the EU an environmental pioneer? Is it possible to achieve sustainability by purely technical means? If not: will that mean to end of the growth society? How to deal with the follow-up problems? How will societal change be successful? Are political power and capitalism the main barriers to sustainability? What is the role of emotions and conceptions of normality in the transformation process? To which degree are rebound and shifting effects the reason why sustainability politics fail? How much climate protection can be claimed ethically and legally e.g. on grounds of human rights? And what is freedom? Despite all rhetoric, the weak transition in energy, climate, agriculture and conservation serves as key example in this book. It is shown how the Paris Agreement is weak with regard to details and at the same time overrules the growth society by means of a radical 1,5-1,8 degrees temperature limit. It is shown how emissions trading must - and can - be reformed radically. It is shown why CSR, education, cooperation and happiness research are overrated. And we will see what an integrated politics on climate, biodiversity, nitrogen and soil might look like.  "This book deals with conditions of transformation, governance instruments, ethics and law of sustainability. The relevance of the humanities to sustainability has never before been demonstrated so vividly and broadly as here. And in every area it opens up some completely new perspectives." (Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, Club of Rome, Honorary President) . "Taking a transdisciplinary perspective, the book canvasses the entire spectrum of issues relevant to sustainability. A most valuable and timely contribution to the debate." (Prof. Dr. Klaus Bosselmann, University of Auckland, Author of "The Principle of Sustainability") . "This books breathes life into the concept of sustainability. Felix Ekardt tears down the barriers between disciplines and builds a holistic fundament for sustainablility; fit to guide long-term  decision-making on the necessary transformation and societal change." (Prof. Dr. Christina Voigt, Oslo University, Dept. of Public and International Law).							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291297

291292	1	China's Belt and Road power transition : | preparations and blowbacks /	Chung, Chien-Peng,	Details the Belt and Road global infrastructure development initiative as the most important instrument for China's leadership under Xi Jinping to create an alternative global economic and geopolitical order to challenge the United States. In the opening decades of the twenty-first century the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership under Xi Jinping has created a worldwide Sino-centric network, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), to challenge American dominance in world affairs. Encompassing economic, financial, political, and strategic relations, the CCP's belief is that the funds, construction projects, and promises offered by the BRI will generate a widespread perception of the inexorability, legitimacy, and thus acceptability of a Chinese world order. Consisting initially of a land-based "Silk Road Economic Belt," an oceangoing "Maritime Silk Road," and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the BRI has expanded to involve more than 140 countries and includes a Health Silk Road, Digital Silk Road, and Polar Silk Road, but it has also experienced serious challenges. Using power transition theory, Chien-peng Chung carefully investigates and evaluates the enterprise's benefits and shortcomings, concluding that it is still too early to consider the BRI a success.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291292
291291	1	Pluralizing humanism : | religions and secularisms beyond power /	Jakelic, Slavica,	Humanism is appealed to today whenever we want to tackle the conditions of dehumanization in the contemporary world. But for humanism to be viable in the twenty first century, this book argues, it needs to be pluralized. Employing theoretical, historical, and sociological arguments, this book moves beyond the discourse of critique. It engages theories of religion and secularism, as well as postmodern, postcolonial, and decolonial critiques of Western humanist projects, to uncover the ideas and practices of religious and secular humanisms when they challenge dehumanization in the pursuit of conditions of flourishing for all. Through studies of the Solidarity movement in Poland and the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, the book demonstrates the centrality of humanist traditions to the emergence of religious-secular solidarities that transformed the political landscapes of the world. By highlighting the instances in which humanisms functioned as checks on each other's absolutist claims, the book contends that humanisms supply a constructive path for addressing the challenges of our time--a time of radically divided societies and intolerant, even violent, forms of nationalism. A challenge to the critiques of humanism that seek to identify it solely as the legacy of the West, as anti-religious discourse, or relegate it to the domain of power constellations, Pluralizing Humanism highlights the rich plurality of humanist discourses and the need for their mutual engagements. It points to humanist ideals as constitutive of politics that can guide our human power because they are irreducible to it. As such, this book will appeal to social scientists, social theorists, religious studies scholars, and ethicists with interests in religion, secularism, social movements, and humanist thought and practice.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291291
291290	1	Global and regional strategies in the Middle East : | in pursuit of hegemony /	Nicolas, Leila,	Global and Regional Strategies in the Middle East explores hegemony in the Middle East through understanding different dimensions of power politics and the consequences of the hegemonic ambitions of both global and regional powers. The book adds new aspects to the extensive literature on grand strategies in the Middle East by exploring and evaluating competing strategies from an "insider" perspective. First, it highlights the main determinants of Global powers' grand strategies, assesses the ones applied in the Middle East, and forecasts future strategies after the Ukraine war in alignment with other rival states' capabilities and goals. It then underlines regional dynamics and the hegemonic quest of regional powers and their power politics' determinants since the "War on terror," the Arab Spring, and, more recently, the Russian intervention in Ukraine and Israel-Gaza conflict. The book broadens readers' perspectives by clarifying the region's dynamics that shaped the global and regional power rivalries, where security concerns, economic interests, oil supplies, and hegemonic ambitions make it complicated for the US to keep influence and the total control it had during the late 20th century. This book will be of great interest to scholars and students of the MENA region, International Relations and Strategic Studies.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291290
291289	1	Arms transfers to Non-State Actors : | the erosion of norms in international law /	Kiel, Hannah,	This insightful book analyses the issue of norm erosion in international law by examining arms transfers to non-state actors. Balancing empirical research with legal theory, the author dissects recent case studies, tracing individual changes in norms against a background of systemic transformation. Arms Transfers to Non-State Actors follows changes in the prohibition of arms transfers to non-state actors since the pivotal International Court of Justice's Nicaragua ruling in 1986. Hannah Kiel critically discusses the legal developments through relevant case studies, including Abkhazia, Bosnia, Congo, Eastern Ukraine, Kosovo, Libya, Northern Iraq, South Ossetia, Syria and Yemen. Adopting a customary law perspective while also placing the narratives of states in the context of international structural changes, Kiel emphasises the interplay between state practice and the strengthening of a human rights-based paradigm. Kiel ultimately shows that changes in norms at the individual level indicate a larger transformation in the international order, and while the arming of non-state actors remains formally illegal, the prohibition of this practice is informally eroding. Interdisciplinary in scope, this book provides valuable insights for scholars and researchers of public international law, human rights, international humanitarian law, and international relations. It is also of great benefit to human rights lawyers, policymakers, and diplomats.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291289
291288	1	Flexible hybrid work /	Vartiainen, Matti,	Despite hybrid work becoming increasingly relevant since the COVID-19 pandemic, exactly what the phenomenon entails remains a burgeoning field of research. Matti Vartiainen explores this shift in working culture and what it means for staff wellbeing and performance, as well as how remote work policies can be implemented effectively. This book assesses the flexibility paradigm which hybrid work hinges on, surveying the elements of hybrid work and how it has been addressed in national policy debates in Europe and telework literature overall. Examining the potential hindrances and challenges of hybrid working as well as the benefits and opportunities that it creates, the book presents important findings on the current implementation of this style of work. Finally, Vartiainen looks to the future of hybrid work, and ultimately argues that combining basic work elements and life spaces with trust-based leadership styles will generate functional organisational solutions for diverse purposes, aims, and contexts. Studying past remote and telework experiences to inform future research and policy development, this book will prove a valuable read to organisational researchers, consultants and human resource practitioners. It will also appeal to scholars of organisational psychology and management studies.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291288
291287	1	Un mediators in Syria : | the challenges and responsibilities of conflict resolution /	Nassar, Fadi Nicholas,	Since 2011, the conflict in Syria has been one of the most catastrophic conflicts of our time and a dark stain on the peacemaking abilities of the United Nations (UN). At the heart of this book is a simple but critical question - what do UN mediators tasked with the responsibility to make peace actually do? By explaining this, the book offers a detailed record of what Kofi Annan, Lakhdar Brahimi, and Staffan de Mistura did in their roles as UN mediators in Syria and presents a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics that shaped their decision-making. Beyond the cases of these three mediators, Fadi Nicholas Nassar introduces a method by which to forensically identify a mediator's fingerprints on the peacemaking process and charts a map to examine their decision-making processes. In doing so, it paves the way to evaluate the performance of these mediators - to hold them accountable for their successes and failures.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291287
291286	1	The emerging role of AI-based expert systems in cyber defense and security /		The world, especially developing countries, is going through digital transformation. Digital transformation of businesses, cities, manufacturing sector, service sector, government offices and procedures, vehicles (Internet enabled vehicles), and Industry 4.0 are taking place at a distinguished pace and have many rewards. Digital transformation helps to address many social, techno-financial, and governance issues, but it also carries many challenges like increased volume of cyber-attacks, privacy concerns, security threats, digital identity threat, phishing frauds, operational security, and many other vulnerabilities. Aforesaid challenges have become a common phenomenon in today's interconnected world. It is the time when cyber-security must be stationed as a central issue and be established as a management issue besides a technological issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation. Work from home (remote working) and learn from home (online learning) are the new normal of life. The repercussions set by the COVID-19 pandemic will outlast the post-pandemic era. AI can help human society to resolve modern issues of cyber security. AI can be used by organizations to mitigate risks and increase revenue by detecting cyber threats and fraud at an early stage. Although keeping up with new viruses and malware updates is becoming more difficult, cyber security using artificial intelligence technologies will facilitate the detection and response to threats and malware by using previous cyber-attack data to determine the best course of action. AI may often be better and more effective than humans in detecting malicious malware. The faster the data breach was identified and contained, the lower the costs. This book will fill the gaps between artificial intelligence and its usage in cyber security and defense.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291286

291278	1	The ethics of remote warfare /	Hamourtziadou, Lily,	Ethical approaches to war require that we don't value only the lives of 'our' people, as Realism asserts; that we don't enforce our sense of justice with weapons, as Militarism demands our 'moral warriors' do; that force is used only in self-defence, based on the principles of Just War Theory. However, can there be purely defensive or moral wars? This book offers unique insights into twenty-first century warfare through three approaches - Realism, Militarism, and Just war Theory - in the context of 'precision' weapons, celebrated for minimising risks to soldiers and civilians. The author questions whether the rapidly developing technology of lethal autonomous weapons is actually expanding an existing legal-ethical issue: the problem of civilian harm. Laws permits acts that cause incidental civilian harm; AI warfare puts the law's accountability gap into sharper relief, highlighting the need for new accountability mechanisms that reflect a sense of legal and moral justice.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291278

291276	1	Psychological foundations of the entrepreneurial mindset /	Shaver, Kelly G.,	Highlighting three decades of key research and emphasizing the psychological processes that characterize us all, Psychological Foundations of The Entrepreneurial Mindsetmoves away from the traditional focus on the entrepreneurial ecosystem to provide a novel investigation at the level of the individuals themselves. Identifying important questions including: Does the entrepreneur have a strong vision? Can the person execute successfully? and how will he or she recover if the business encounters setbacks? Kelly Shaver discusses how these judgements relate to an individual person, not a business. The book analyses the foundations of an entrepreneur's mindset including sensation and perception, cognition, motivation and elements of personality, and considers how these factors contribute to ongoing behavior distinguishing one entrepreneur from another.

291275	1	Addressing hybrid threats : | European Law and policies /		Combining rich theoretical analysis with real-world examples, this erudite book navigates EU law in the context of hybrid threats, examining how security issues affect themes of constitutional law at the heart of a democratic system. Presenting doctrinal and historical insights, the book not only considers the different types of hybrid threats, but also how they are increasingly showing that traditional understandings of security risk are becoming obsolete. Bringing together leading experts in the fields of security, anthropology, and EU law, chapters map out the EU and NATO's responses to five hybrid threats: disinformation, instrumentalisation of migration, cyberthreats, abuses of energy resources, and lawfare. The book focuses on both security and legal issues and answers two interrelated questions: what is the nature of a hybrid threat? And what legal tools are available to the EU to protect its citizens from those threats? The answers to these questions reveal how hybrid threats put increased tension on the capacity of a democratic system to resist rival models. Interdisciplinary in scope, this will be a fundamental resource for researchers, academics and students of European law, terrorism and security law, politics, and international relations. Legal practitioners with a keen interest in EU constitutional law, common foreign and security policy, and internal market regulation will similarly find this to be an indispensable read.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291275

By providing a comprehensive exploration of diverse perspectives, it empowers readers to engage with the pressing issues facing these regions. This is a useful resource for students and researchers in public policy and governance studies, development studies and NGOs, and Middle East and African Studies.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291274
291273	1	Making space for the Gulf : | histories of regionalism and the Middle East /	Keshavarzian, Arang,	The Arabian Gulf [Persian Gulf] has long been a contested space—an object of imperial ambitions, national antagonisms, and migratory dreams. The roots of these contestations lie in the different ways the Gulf has been defined as a region, both by those who live there and those beyond its shore. Making Space for the Gulf reveals how capitalism, empire-building, geopolitics, and urbanism have each shaped understandings of the region over the last two centuries. Here, the Gulf comes into view as a created space, encompassing dynamic social relations and competing interests. Arang Keshavarzian writes a new history of the region that places Iran, Iraq, and the Arabian Peninsula together within global processes. He connects moments more often treated as ruptures—the discovery of oil, the Iranian Revolution, the rise and decline of British empire, the emergence of American power—and crafts a narrative populated by a diverse range of people—migrants and ruling families, pearl-divers and star architects, striking taxi drivers and dethroned rulers, protectors of British India and stewards of globalized American universities. Tacking across geographic scales, Keshavarzian reveals how the Gulf has been globalized through transnational relations, regionalized as a geopolitical category, and cleaved along national divisions and social inequalities. When understood as a process, not an object, the Persian Gulf reveals much about how regions and the world have been made in modern times. Making Space for the Gulf offers a fresh understanding of this globally consequential place.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291273

291269	1	Pax Economica : | Left-Wing visions of a free trade world /	Palen, Marc-William,	The forgotten history of the liberal radicals, socialist internationalists, feminists, and Christians who envisioned free trade as the necessary prerequisite for anti-imperialism and peace Today, free trade is often associated with right-wing free marketeers. In Pax Economica, historian Marc-William Palen shows that free trade and globalisation in fact have roots in nineteenth-century left-wing politics. In this counterhistory of an idea, Palen explores how, beginning in the 1840s, left-wing globalists became the leaders of the peace and anti-imperialist movements of their age. By the early twentieth century, an unlikely alliance of liberal radicals, socialist internationalists, feminists, and Christians envisioned free trade as essential for a prosperous and peaceful world order. Of course, this vision was at odds with the era's strong predilections for nationalism, protectionism, geopolitical conflict, and colonial expansion. Palen reveals how, for some of its most radical left-wing adherents, free trade represented a hard-nosed critique of imperialism, militarism, and war. Palen shows that the anti-imperial component of free trade was a phenomenon that came to encompass the political left wing within the British, American, Spanish, German, Dutch, Belgian, Italian, Russian, French, and Japanese empires. The left-wing vision of a "pax economica" evolved to include supranational regulation to maintain a peaceful free-trading system--which paved the way for a more liberal economic order after World War II and such institutions as the United Nations, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization. Palen's findings upend how we think about globalisation, free trade, anti-imperialism, and peace. Rediscovering the left-wing history of globalism offers timely lessons for our own era of economic nationalism and geopolitical conflict.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291269
291268	1	The golden passport : | global mobility for millionaires /	Surak, Kristin,	"[A] fascinating study of how people―and their capital―seek to move around a world that is at once hugely interconnected and driven by inequities...definitive, detailed, and unusually nuanced." ―Atossa Araxia Abrahamian, Foreign Affairs The first comprehensive on-the-ground investigation of the global market for citizenship, examining the wealthy elites who buy passports, the states and brokers who sell them, and the normalization of a once shadowy practice. Our lives are in countless ways defined by our citizenship. The country we belong to affects our rights, our travel possibilities, and ultimately our chances in life. Obtaining a new citizenship is rarely easy. But for those with the means--billionaires like Peter Thiel and Jho Low, but also countless unknown multimillionaires--it's just a question of price. More than a dozen countries, many of them small islands in the Mediterranean, Caribbean, and South Pacific, sell citizenship to 50,000 people annually. Through six years of fieldwork on four continents, Kristin Surak discovered how the initially dubious sale of passports has transformed into a full-blown citizenship industry that thrives on global inequalities. Some "investor citizens" hope to parlay their new passport into visa-free travel--or use it as a stepping stone to residence in countries like the United States. Other buyers take out a new citizenship as an insurance policy or to escape state control at home. Almost none, though, intend to move to their selected country and live among their new compatriots, whose relationship with these global elites is complex. A groundbreaking study of a contentious practice that has become popular among the nouveaux riches, The Golden Passport takes readers from the details of the application process to the geopolitical hydraulics of the citizenship industry. It's a business that thrives on uncertainty and imbalances of power between big, globalized economies and tiny states desperate for investment. In between are the fascinating stories of buyers, brokers, and sellers, all ready to profit from the citizenship trade.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291268

291266	1	Data is everybody's business : | the fundamentals of data monetization /	Wixom, Barbara Haley,	A clear, engaging, evidence-based guide to monetizing data, for everyone from employee to board member. Most organizations view data monetization--converting data into money--too narrowly: as merely selling data sets. But data monetization is a core business activity for both commercial and noncommercial organizations, and, within organizations, it's critical to have wide-ranging support for this pursuit. In Data Is Everybody's Business, the authors offer a clear and engaging way for people across the entire organization to understand data monetization and make it happen. The authors identify three viable ways to convert data into money--improving work with data, wrapping products with data, and selling information offerings--and explain when to pursue each and how to succeed. Key features of the book: *       Grounded in twenty-eight years of academic research, including nine years of research at the MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research (MIT CISR) *       Definitions of key terms, self-reflection questions, appealing graphics, and easy-to-use frameworks *       Rich with detailed case studies *       Supplemented by free MIT CISR website resources (cisr.mit.edu) Ideal for organizations engaged in data literacy training, data-driven transformation, or digital transformation, Data Is Everybody's Business is the essential guide for helping everybody in the organization--not just the data specialists--understand, get excited about, and participate in data monetization.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291266
291265	1	The development of an art history in the UAE : | an art not made to be understood /	Kazan Makhlouf, Sophie,	This book draws together an oral and visual art history of a country that is extremely rich in culture and history but that is often overlooked or underestimated. By observing the country's history and visual culture and the artistic practices of select artists from the UAE, it considers the development of contemporary art from the UAE. This will increase accessibility to art by Emiratis and underline its wider relevance. There is a dearth of literature on contemporary art by Emiratis, and this may be one of the reasons contemporary art from the UAE is under-represented globally. In order to help the reader better understand art from the UAE, this book traces the country's historical make-up, its culture and contemporary art tradition through oral histories based on interviews with a wide variety of artists and people working in the art industries. It also explores this development using global art discourses that are relevant to art produced in the UAE today. This book also considers how cultural and artistic identities are formed and explores the political and socio-economic interests in the country that have stimulated art practices and appreciation. For so long, an exclusively Western narrative has dominated Art, and popular media portrays the Gulf's accomplishments in development and modernity with suspicion. Thanks to the UAE's espousal of the Internet and online communities over the last decade, this book is particularly timely. Following the pandemic, a wider understanding of global art discourses, values and perceptions are increasingly welcomed. Art from the UAE bridges the local and the global, giving a voice and a visual presence to a country's contemporary art tradition that has been widely overlooked. The UAE has a distinct visual arts tradition that relates to a broader and inclusive understanding of art centered on development and change.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291265
291264	1	An unwritten future : | realism and uncertainty in world politics /	Kirshner, Jonathan,	An argument for the classical realist approach to world politics An Unwritten Future offers a fresh reassessment of classical realism, an enduring approach to understanding crucial events in the international political arena. Jonathan Kirshner identifies the fundamental flaws of classical realism's would-be successors and shows how this older, more nuanced and sophisticated method for studying world politics better explains the formative events of the past. Kirshner also reveals how this approach is ideally equipped to comprehend the vital questions of the present--such as the implications of China's rise, the ways that social and economic change alter the balance of power and the nature of international conflict, and the consequences of the end of the US-led postwar order for the future of world politics. Laying out realism's core principles, Kirshner discusses the contributions of the perspective's key thinkers, including Thucydides, Hans Morgenthau, and Raymond Aron, among others. He illustrates how a classical realist approach gives new insights into major upheavals of the twentieth century, such as Britain's appeasement of Nazi Germany and America's ruinous involvement in Vietnam. Kirshner also addresses realism's limits and explores contemporary issues, including the ascent of great power challengers, the political implications of globalization, and the diffusion of power in modern world politics. A reexamination of the realist tradition, with a renewed emphasis on the crucial roles played by uncertainty, contingency, and contestation, An Unwritten Future demonstrates how a once-popular school of thought provides invaluable insights into pressing real-world problems.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291264

291240	2	Iranian political thought: | roots, influences, impact /	Al-Nuaimi, Sultan Mohammed	In presenting a comprehensive examination of Iranian political thought, this book addresses key questions that aim to outline its nature and defining features. How has Shiite political thought, both the Akhbari and Usuli (rationalist) branches, shaped the overall evolution of Iranian political thought? What were the main developmental phases of Shiite political thought, and how were these ideas affected, positively or negatively, by each successive dynasty and political regime that has ruled Iran? In what ways have modern intellectual ideas influenced Iranian political ideology, and how has this influence manifested? The impact of the Iranian Revolution is also examined, considering how, in its aftermath, Iran's leading religious group was able to take the concept of Wilayat Al-Faqih to the highest levels of authority, shaping Islamic government. What theories were proposed by religious, liberal and leftist groups as alternative ruling systems after the fall of the Shah? Crucially, how were religious forces able to undermine these liberal and leftist currents to take power? And in taking over, what mechanisms were used to adapt state institutions to align with Shiite political ideology? The analysis also turns to the second decade of the Iranian Revolution, exploring new political perspectives that emerged within the broader religious establishment, advocating for alternatives to the absolute concept of Wilayat Al-Faqih. Key questions include: What drove these shifts in perspective among both traditionalists and reformists in the religious regime, particularly on the concept of Wilayat Al-Faqih and the political system in Iran? What were the key features of the alternative political system proposed by the nationalist liberal movement? And finally, what is the outlook for Iran's political system, given domestic tensions, and current regional and international dynamics? All of these questions contribute to developing a deeper understanding of Iran's political system and climate.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291240

291236	2	سورية ما بعد الحرب وقبل السلام : | تحديات التحول إلى الدولة المدنية /		كيف سيتطور الوضع في سورية، وحولها، خلال المدى المنظور؟ إن الإجابة على هذا السؤال لا تهم الشعب السوري في الداخل والخارج وحسب، وإنما هي أيضاً قضية إقليمية ذات تأثير كبير على مستقبل منطقة الهلال الخصيب. لطالما استمدت سورية أهميتها الإقليمية والدولية من موقعها الجغرافي الاستراتيجي شرقي البحر الأبيض المتوسط، ومن توَسُّطها مجموعة من دول الشرق الأوسط ذات الأهمية الحيوية مثل تركيا والعراق والأردن، التي كانت أيضاً نقطة وصل حيوية مع دول الخليج العربي. وإنْ تراجعت أهمية الموقف السوري حيال قضايا المنطقة والدول المجاورة بعد الحرب بشكل ملحوظ، فإن القضايا التي نشأت عن الصراع في سورية لها أهمية حاسمة في أمن المنطقة، وأدوار الفاعلين الإقليميين، إذ باتت البلاد بوابة للقوى المختلفة التي تسعى للتأثير في شؤون المنطقة والدول المحيطة بها.يهدف هذا الإصدار إلى تقديم تصوُّر حول مستقبل الصراع السوري، والاتّجاه الذي قد يسلكه على المدى المنظور. ويتناول في الفصل الأول السيناريوهات المتعلقة بشكل سورية المستقبلي، مُركِّزاً النقاش حول اللامركزية والمركزية في الإدارة والتقسيمات الفعلية على الأرض. ثم يتطرق في الفصل الثاني إلى تشكيلة الاقتصاد السوري، مُقدِّماً تحليلاً للحالة الراهنة واستشراف المسارات المستقبلية التي رسمتها ظروف الحرب. ولا يمكن اعتبار هذا الفحص مكتملاً دون التطرُّق إلى أدوار الفاعلين الإقليميين والدوليين في سورية، والأشكال المحتملة لتلك الأدوار في المستقبل القريب، وهو ما يتناوله الفصل الثالث. أما الفصل الرابع فيدور النقاش فيه حول مستقبل السوريين المهجرين، سواء أكانوا داخل البلاد أم في الشتات.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291236

291234	2	ولاية سيناء : | تحولات العنف الجهادي في مصر /	شلاطة، أحمد زغلول،	مع ارتباط دورة حياة تنظيمات العنف الديني بصورة رئيسة بمحفزات سياسية واجتماعية تكون بمنزلة مُسببات النشوء وآليات الحل الجبري والتحلل الذاتي، نجد الوضع مختلفًا في حال تنظيم “ولاية سيناء” الذي لا يزال مستمرًا في المشهد الجهادي على الرغم من الاستراتيجيات الأمنية والعسكرية القائمة في وجهه، ليكون التساؤل الرئيسي الذي يطرح نفسه في هذا الكتاب: ما الذي توافر لـ”ولاية سيناء” ولم يتوافر لأقرانه من ممارسي العنف فجعله يستمر في عنفه على الرغم من شراسة المواجهات المضادة له؟طَوال سَنوات المواجهة سعى تنظيم “الولاية” إلى الاستفادة من البيئات المحلية والدولية من أجل إطالة بقائه؛ فحاول التّمدد إلى خارج سيناء عبر شبكة من الخَلايا العُنقودية التي تَعمل بصفة لامركزية بهدف تَخفيف الضّغوط عن مركز التنظيم في سيناء، فضلًا عن الإفادة من حالة الغضب والنزعة إلى الانتقام من ممارسات النظام الحاكم عبر توسيع قاعدة التنظيم من الداعمين المحتملين وتوظيفهم في مشروعه، وهو ما ساعده على الاستمرار في ممارسة العنف. ورغم نجاح الحلول الأمنية والعسكرية في تقويض نشاط العنف إلى حد بعيد، فإن عدم القضاء التام على “ولاية سيناء”، رغم حدة المواجهات، يتطلب إعادة النظر في تفعيل استراتيجيات المقاومة النّاعِمة ضمن استراتيجية مُكافحة الإرهاب. وعليه يطمح هذا الكتاب إلى أن يكون مدخلًا إلى فهم وتفكيك تنظيمات العنف الديني وتطوير استراتيجيات مكافحة الإرهاب في مصر.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291234

291227	2	المسؤولية المدنية عن مضار النشاط النووي والإشعاعي /	الشيخ، طارق عبد العزيز حنفي	أهمية الطاقة للبشر وللنشاط البشرى ليست بالأمر الجديد، فالطاقة هي المحرك الأساسي للثورة الصناعية منذ نهايات القرن التاسع عشر، وربما لم يكن بالمصادفة البحتة، أن يتم في نفس الفترة تقريبا كشف ظاهرة النشاط الإشعاعي، فلم يكن مجرد التفكير فى إمكانية الحصول على الطاقة من الذرة أو نواتها ممكنا قبل كشف تلك الظاهرة ، فقد فتح الكشف عن النشاط الإشعاعي بابا جديدا من أبواب البحث العلمي، وكان من نتائج التفاعل المتبادل بين الحقائق التجريبية والآراء النظرية في هذا النطاق حدوث تطور واضح في فكر العلماء عن تركيب الذرة والنواة، والوصول إلى الوضع الراهن فيما يتعلق بإنتاج واستخدام الطاقة النووية.وتمثل القوة النووية نقلة كبيرة، سواء على النطاق الاقتصادى أو السياسي أو الأمني، فبعد انتهاء الحرب العالمية الثانية ثم انتهاء الحرب الباردة، كحقبتين هامتين أظهرتا القوة النووية وخطورتها على البشرية فإن العالم قد بذل نظرته تجاهها من كونها أداة حرب إلى كونها وسيلة للاستخدامات السلمية والتطوير مستلزمات الحياة، ومن أهم استخداماتها إنتاج الطاقة. وتمثل الطاقة النووية مصدرا هاما من مصادر الطاقة بجانب الوقود التقليدي، الأحفورى، الذى يشمل البترول والغاز والفحم، وتبدو أهمية الطاقة النووية من حيث أن الوقود الأحفورى لن يبقى زمنا طويلا ، حيث تتوقع الدراسات التي يجريها المتخصصون أن تنفد هذه المصادر خلال عشرات السنوات ، وعلى الرغم من الأمال العريضة المعقودة على الطاقة النووية فإن هناك العديد من المخاطر والمخاوف التي تحيط باستخدام هذه الطاقة في المجالين السلمي والعسكري.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291227

291174	1	Rethinking Migration : | Challenging Borders, Citizenship and Race /	Martins Junior, Angelo,	Available open access digitally under CC-BY-NC-ND licence. Humans have always moved, but across the world 'migration' has become a major policy, political and media concern. How can we understand human movement without positioning 'the migrant' as a problem? This interdisciplinary collection rethinks migration and movement. It explores mobility beyond the human and across time, from the movement of soil in the Middle Ages to contemporary cow passports. It also examines the histories of international borders and how they are intertwined with the politics of race and nation. The book illustrates that conceptually based, critical and creative thinking is as important for practice as it is for theory and can help us understand and respond to migration as a force that connects rather than divides.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291174

291171	1	Art Intelligence : | How Generative AI Relates to Human Art-Making /	Svenungsson, Jan,	Artists always react to the times in which they live. They may celebrate them or criticize them, often trying to change them. But this is the first time in history that technology controlled by private companies is offering to replace the work of writers, musicians, illustrators and visual artists. What impact will generative AI have on how we create art and how we understand what art is for? How will it affect the role of the artist in the future and the conditions under which artists will work? Jan Svenungsson tackles these questions, investigating what AI might do for art, and what it might change, circling the core issue of what it is in human art-making that cannot be replaced.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291171

Thanks to the latest photographic technologies, we can now take photos in computer games, interpolate them in extended reality platforms, or synthesize them via artificial intelligence. To account for the most recent shifts in conceptualizations of photography, this book proposes the term virtual photography as a binding theoretical framework, defined as a photography that retains the efficiency and function of real photography (made with or without a camera) while manifesting these in an unfamiliar or noncustomary form.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291162

291160	1	The World's Constitution : | Spheres of Liberty in the Future Global Order /	Webb, Adam Kempton,	Global governance is tightening and foreshadows world state formation becoming a live political issue in this century. Some observers treat it as inevitable amid the urgency of global issues. They foresee a technocratic scaling up of the model of state authority that has prevailed at the national level for over two hundred years. Many critics and members of the public around the world look askance at that prospect. They rightly fear a moral vacuum of authority disconnected from the world's traditions, and a concentration of power that would be damaging to liberty or even dystopian in its upshot. Still, they often merely aim to stand athwart the scaling up of political institutions, rather than actively trying to shape an alternative that can seize the global horizon. The World's Constitution: Spheres of Liberty in the Future Global Order offers a radically different vision of future world order that could work in a global space while shifting the balance of power from state back to society. It draws on older resources in political thought, both Western and non-Western, to upend mainstream notions of statehood and sovereignty that have been taken for granted for too long in the modern era. It offers an original 'sphere pluralist' framework that can reconcile liberty, tradition, and cosmopolitanism. As a book rooted in the past but mindful of future constitutional and policy challenges, it bridges ideas and real world implications, with insights that cut across a wide range of topics from migration and social welfare to personal law systems and channels of representation. It opens an exciting debate about global constitutional futures that is likely to become more salient over the next couple of generations							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291160

291148	1	Harvest Loss in China : | rice, mechanization, and the moral hazard of outsourcing /	Qu, Xue.	This open access book examines food security in China with a specific focus on rice harvesting. As the most populous agricultural developing country, China's food security is closely related to the world's food security. An urgent issue internationally, data show that every year, about one-third of food is lost and wasted before it even reaches the market, mainly in less developed countries. To this end, halving the amount of food loss and waste is one of the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2021, the Chinese government issued the Anti-Food Waste Law of the People's Republic of China, placing a high priority on food loss reduction. Rice, one of the major staple foods, has also received a higher priority in government policy, as it has been deemed required to be "absolutely safe". In China, rice farmers rely heavily on outsourcing services to complete harvesting, which has led to the rapid development of mechanical harvesting. This book shows that the essence of outsourcing services is a principal-agent relationship in which there is a potential moral hazard, which is considered detrimental to harvest losses. The book analyses the effect of the moral hazard in harvest outsourcing services on rice harvest losses from this principal-agent theoretical perspective. Using the latest nationwide farmer survey, it empirically demonstrates the moral hazard in agricultural outsourcing services and its negative impact on harvest losses, providing suggestions for food loss reduction in China and similar developing countries where agricultural outsourcing services are developing rapidly. Relevant to social science researchers working in areas of food security in connection with the SDGs, and to scholars studying development in China more generally, this is a timely contribution confronting possible means of food loss reduction, in the developing world particularly, in the East, and globally.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291148
291147	1	Revisiting Premodern Islamic Science and Experience /	Erlwein, Hannah C.	This open access book takes a fresh look at the nature and place of experience in premodern Islamic science. It seeks to answer two questions: What kind of experience constituted premodern Islamic science? And in what ways did that experience constitute science? Answering these questions, the authors critique the trajectory of most existing histories of the period, which tend to reduce "experience" to empirical method or practice. This view reflects the emphasis that histories of modern science, especially of the Scientific Revolution, have placed on empiricism--the standard against which Islamic actors were then measured. This book offers a new historiography, arguing that experience had a far wider scope in the world of Islamic science. Combining an innovative theoretical framework with three case studies and a reflective epilogue by renowned experts in the field, this work offers the history of science a solid foundation on which to build its analyses of premodern science and the modality, scope, and role of experience therein. As a result, it speaks to specialists in the history of premodern Islamic science and historians of science in general to reconsider their historiographical assumptions.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291147
291146	1	Shipping Out : | Race, Performance, and Labor at Sea /	Gonzalez, Anita.	Shipping Out: Race, Performance, and Labor at Sea provides a rare perspective on performance by staff above and below deck on Caribbean cruise ships, as viewed through the lenses of race, class, and gender. Drawing on her experiences as a destination lecturer on Caribbean cruise lines for twenty years, Anita Gonzalez offers a unique viewpoint as she examines contemporary Caribbean cruise culture as an ethnographically complex site where North American and European travelers are exposed to other cultures through the orchestrated experiences on ship, and via excursions to ports. Gonzales argues that the cruise ship experience is deliberately crafted to deliver the best immersive performance by its workers. However, the workers never leave the theater, they merely move below deck--and like ships' stewards and cooks from previous centuries, they work within an imaginary where Global Majority people are envisioned as servants. By utilizing ethnography and archival materials to illustrate ship workers' experiences on contemporary cruise ships, and then contrasting those circumstances with the personal accounts of workers on historical merchant ships, Shipping Out illuminates how workers' presence on ships complicates notions of freedom and enslavement, home and journey, place and space.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291146
291145	1	The future of cultural analysis : | a critical inquiry /	Aydemir, Murat,	Across the humanities and the social sciences, "cultural analysis" is a vibrant research practice. Since its introduction in the 1990s, its main principles have remained largely the same: interdisciplinarity, political urgency, a heuristic use of concepts, the detailed analysis of objects of culture, and an awareness of the scholar's situatedness in the present. But is the practice still suited to the spiraling of social, political, and environmental crises that mark our time? Drawing on experiences in research, teaching, activism, and the creative arts, contributors explore what cultural analysis was back then, what it is now, and what it may be by 2034. In a shifting conjuncture, contributors strike notes of discomfort, defiance, and irony--as well as a renewed sense of urgency and care.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291145

The work supports the making of better-informed decisions, especially by industrial or regulatory actors, to engage or not with public participation.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291141
291140	1	Harvesting the sea in Southeastern Arabia : | Volume 1: regional studies /	Watson, Janet C. E.	Traditional livelihoods and the ecosystems that sustain them are dying out around the world. This book is a collection of research on the relationships between people, their environment, their expertise and their languages along the ecologically fragile coasts of the Arabian Peninsula. These studies are the outcome of many years of collaborative fieldwork with local communities in three main regions of southern and eastern Arabia: the Musandam Peninsula, Dhofar and al-Mahrah, and the island of Soqotra. Bringing together oral literature, traditional scientific knowledge, and marine subsistence at the peripheries of the Arabian seaboard, the volume makes a major contribution to the documentation of the indigenous Modern South Arabian languages (MSAL), regional Arabic, and the Kumzari language, as well as to a greater understanding of their speakers' mastery in harvesting the seas. Diverse contributions by scholars and language community members explore the songs and stories, experiences and viewpoints of indigenous fishers, and shed light on the cultural significance of the maritime species encountered by each community. This book is a testimony to resilient ways of life, many of which have vanished, but which at the same time may offer unique answers for the future of humanity.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291140

291138	1	Experiences of Health Risks : | Prevention, Power Dynamics and Inequalities /	Burton-Jeangros, Claudine.	This book focuses on health risks, a domain in which risk expansion has been particularly prolific. As a result of massive gains in scientific knowledge, made possible by statistical developments, data accumulation and computerisation over the last decades, more and more attention has been geared towards risks in the fields of public health and medicine. Specifically directed towards concrete experiences of health risks, the book analyses the social contexts in which these experiences occur to understand how people, in their diverse positions, actually think, feel, act, and interact around experiences of risk. The author argues that recurrent debates about risk exist because most of the time the notion leaves aside the complexity of social processes surrounding actual experiences and interpretations of vulnerability and danger in society. This book will be of interest to students and scholars of sociology of health and medicine and risk studies, as well as health professionals and policy-makers facing the complexity of acting and deciding in the risk society.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291138
291137	1	Towards Rethinking Politics, Policy and Polity in the Anthropocene : | Multidisciplinary Perspectives /	Brauch, Hans Günter.	Humankind faces two anthropogenic threats to its survival that are closely linked. The first is the end of the Holocene and the start of the Anthropocene, which was marked by the test of a nuclear bomb on 16 July 1945. In the prevailing peace and security narrative, nuclear weapons and the 'other' (country, bloc or alliance) pose a perceived threat to humankind's survival. In the Anthropocene narrative, 'we are the threat' through our way of life and the burning of fossil fuels. The start of the Anthropocene coincides with a change in the international order with the setting up of the UN and the Bretton Woods Institutions. Three stages of this order are distinguished: the Cold War (bipolarity), the post-Cold War era (unipolarity), and the end of the rule-based global liberal order (multipolarity) on 24 February 2022. In this book ten multidisciplinary perspectives discuss complexity, Anthropocene geopolitics, peace and security discourses and the debate on the Anthropocene, planetary boundaries, complex crises and integrative geography in the Anthropocene, governance and politics, and the Patriacene and gender. Both existential threats for humankind are illustrated by cover photos of the first nuclear weapons test on 16 July 1945 and by Category 5 Hurricane Otis, an extreme weather event impacting on Acapulco in Mexico on 25 October 2023. The Anthropocene as a new epoch of Earth history coincides in 1945 with a change in the international order. In the security and peace narrative, the 'other' and nuclear weapons pose an existential threat; in the Anthropocene narrative. This dual existential change requires a rethinking of politics, policy and polity. In the social sciences, the Anthropocene is being discussed from multidisciplinary perspectives (geography, political science, and peace, security, and gender studies). This is an open access publication.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291137
291136	1	Land Policies in Europe : | Land-Use Planning, Property Rights, and Spatial Development /	Hartmann, Thomas.	Land is a scarce resource. How can conflicting claims to land be reconciled? How can more housing be provided and, at the same time, the ecological goal of reducing land take be met? In many European countries, land-use planning is facing increasing and oftentimes contradictory challenges. This forms a land question, which requires land policies that can deal with the fraught relationship between planning and private property rights. A legislative reflex is to adapt planning laws. Oftentimes, such changes lack a deeper reflection of land policy and its implications. Especially an international comparison can foster a structured reflection of the own land policy. This thought-provoking book compiles a remarkable collection of 12 cases unveiling how land policies work. Curated by leading experts in the field, it takes the reader on a journey through the multifaceted realm of land policies across the continent. This book offers valuable insights into the complex interplay between land use, and property rights. "Land Policies in Europe" isn't just a book; it's a conversation starter equally relevant for experienced academics or young students, policymakers, and practitioners. This is an open access book.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291136

291134	1	Beyond International Intervention : | Politics of Improvement in Serbia /	Kusic, Katarina.	Studies of statebuilding and peacebuilding have been criticized for their disregard of people living the consequences of intervention projects. Beyond International Intervention takes on the task of engaging with spaces and peoples not usually present in IR scholarship to rethink the very concept of "intervention" by paying close attention to how people actually experience and make sense of those efforts. In particular, the book offers a detailed engagement with ethnographic fieldwork in two policy areas in Serbia--agricultural policy and non-formal youth education. By engaging with subjects, the book not only enhances our understanding of intervention, but also uncovers the limitations of the concept. Katarina Kusić argues that the concept limits what we can observe and theorize, and it prevents researchers from engaging with the people living in spaces of intervention as coeval political subjects. As an alternative, she proposes to foreground improvement over "intervention." This reorientation enables researchers to trace hierarchies beyond the local/international dichotomy, expands fields of visibility beyond those prescribed by interventions themselves, and seriously considers the contradictions at the heart of liberalism.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291134

291090	1	Value and Worthlessness : | The Rise of the Populist Right and Other Disruptions in the Anthropology of Capitalism /	Kalb, Don,	Advocating for an interdisciplinary Marxist anthropology of the present, this book uses historical and global anthropology to engage with history, theory, unevenness, and comparison, while using "global ethnography" and "hidden histories" as the keys to social discovery. Kalb's anthropology of value and worthlessness lays bare the logics that currently produce right wing, populist, and nationalist outcomes. The book also battles with the "anthropology of global systems", financialization, and the seductive myths of global middle-class formation, while assessing the theoretical legacies of Eric Wolf, David Graeber, David Harvey, Jonathan Friedman, Marcel Mauss and "moral anthropology", among others							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291090

In this illuminating re-examination of this multifaceted campaign, Beyond the Euromissile Crisis broadens our understanding of anti-nuclear activism, highlighting how it remains a truly global phenomenon. Investigating the motivations, forms of action, and accomplishments of activists from South Africa, Polynesia, Brazil and elsewhere, this volume offers new ways of conceptualizing the chronology of anti-nuclear protest							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291089
291088	1	Citizenship Utopias in the Global South : | The Emergent Forms of Activism in an Era of Disillusionment /		Citizenship Utopias in the Global South is an edited collection of empirical research that explores emergent forms of activism in Africa, Asia, and Latin America in times of multiple crises. At the intersection of hope and disillusionment, the diverse and thought-provoking chapters investigate emerging forms of activism in the Global South--including youth activisms, anti-racism struggles, feminist initiatives, online dissent, and Indigenous movements. In the 2020s, many parts of the world are witnessing contradictory processes of popular claims to rights, livelihoods, and social justice, and subsequent forms of populist authoritarianism and the securitization of civil society. Previously hopeful calls for dignity, democracy, and social justice--through protesting, strikes, civil society campaigns, legal reforms, and elections, for example--have been met with disdain and civic disengagement. This book investigates the re-imagination and pursuit of citizen activism in such times of popular disillusionment. It explores citizenship utopias as social imaginaries that are enacted and that articulate an ideal social order or democratic polity with ideal forms of experiencing citizenship. Its chapters interrogate conventional approaches to citizenship by introducing a nuanced and empirically grounded exploration of the complex ways in which people experience, negotiate, and engage in the societal changes that they aspire towards. The examination of citizenship utopias outlines contemporary signals for transformative futures and their possibilities. The book undertakes a fresh effort at contributing to the shifting terrain of critical development studies, political anthropology, political sociology, and decolonising scholarship by engaging in discussions about citizenship, activism, disillusionment, and future societal alternatives in times of multiple global challenges							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291088
291087	1	Advancing Future-Orientation in Policymaking : | Institutions, Individuals and Risks /	Koskimaa, Vesa,	This book argues that, under certain societal and institutional conditions, party-, interest group- and bureaucracy-based elites can interact positively to extend political timeframes beyond short electoral terms and foster reasoned long-term planning for democratic decision making. Focusing on Finland within a broader analytic framework and comparative context, it unearths institutions and practices that give the elites capacity to curtail democratic short-sightedness and offer long-term solutions for contemporary threats such as economic globalization, climate change, geopolitical competition. The study also reveals factors that condition the operative capacity of future-regarding institutions. This book will be of key interest to scholars, students and practitioners of political science, public policy and administration, elites and management, and futures studies							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291087
291081	1	Visions of Global Environmental Justice : | Comunidades Negras and the War on Drugs in Colombia /	Huezo, Alexander,	Focusing on the lived experiences of Afro-Colombians processing and resisting violence against their ecological communities, Visions of Global Environmental Justice employs accounts of the supernatural narratively and analytically to frame a contemporary struggle for environmental justice. The book applies Achille Mbembé's theorization of necropolitics to the environmental racism of the US War on Drugs in Colombia, specifically the aerial eradication of coca in the comunidades negras of the Pacific Coast. Through critical examination and deconstruction of transnational mythmaking and local oral tradition, Visions of Global Environmental Justice illustrates that non/humans rendered expendable by US-driven drug (necro)politics are indispensable to both the conceptualization and the realization of environmental justice globally. Far from being a study singularly focused on the symptoms of environmental issues, this book creatively guides us toward a broader conceptualization of environmental racism and justice across geographic scales and non/human agencies.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291081
291080	1	Proximity in Design Research : | People, Processes, Products, Philosophy /		Proximity in Design Research explores four constituents of design: people, processes, products and philosophy, and their potential to bridge contemporary gaps through multilevel synergies. The book brings together a variety of design approaches on several scales developed in the collaboration of different agencies and within diverse contexts. Proximity prompts us to explore the challenges and opportunities for research in design, with the widening and closing of distances in unpredictable times such as those during Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the social distance imposed during this unprecedented global health scenario, researchers and professionals across different areas of knowledge have engaged in an extraordinary interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary global cooperation. This reinvented proximity enhanced the ability to cross fields, remove boundaries to collaboration between disciplines and accelerate processes towards an overarching goal: to overcome adversity. This edited collection reflects on what designers have taken from this experience so far, and the possibilities that are foreseen as the concept of Proximity is redefined. This book offers critical knowledge related to both design practice and design theory. It will be of interest to researchers, teachers and students working in the design disciplines.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291080
291079	1	The Global Third Nuclear Age : | Clashing Visions for a New Era in International Politics /	Futter, Andrew,	This book provides an in-depth examination of the technological, geopolitical and normative pressures driving the world into a new, more complex and potentially more dangerous Third Nuclear Age. By adopting an innovative framework for analysis, the book challenges the constrained focus of much of the existing literature by explaining that the pathways to nuclear security for different actors across the globe will vary considerably in this new context. It argues that the Third Nuclear Age will be defined by friction and conflict between 'Nuclear Traditionalists', 'Technological Transformers', 'Hedgers and Balancers', and 'Activists and Protestors', as different interests and visions of the nuclear future clash. The book draws on dozens of interviews and non-English language sources to provide a global approach and looks at the security politics driving the political debate in 20 different countries across the globe. This book will be of much interest to students of nuclear politics, security studies, and International Relations							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291079

290991	1	Muslim mobilities : | geographies of piety and belonging in Tajik Dubai business /	Stephan, Manja,	"A translocal ethnography about Tajik migrants' engagement in projects of reform Islamic life in Dubai, the book maps Gulf migration onto larger geographies of Muslim mobility, piety and belonging across places in Eurasia, the Gulf, and wider Middle East. Spatializing the intersection of migration, work and Muslim piety, the book examines how formations of ethical subjectivity are closely tied to the multiple places that shape migrants' travel itineraries and related experiences of dwelling there and crossing them. Situating these spatial biographies in broader transregional fields of Muslim mobility, connectedness and placemaking, the book explores why in the early 2000s young Tajik Muslims pursued spiritual, social and moral progress in the booming religious economy of Dubai's fur coat business sector. The book's spatial approach works threefold: With a focus on abroad, it interrogates the interplay of spatial perceptions of 'the good elsewhere' with migrants' placemaking 'there'. A second focus is on how multiplicity and flexibility of migrant situatedness (spatially, temporally, socially) in Persianate, Russophone and Arab culturescapes shape mobile pious subjectivities and cosmopolitan belongings. The book also develops a situated Tajik perspective on Gulf migration, that grounds in circulating spatial imaginaries, Muslim knowledge repertories, as well as in individual travel modes, paths and migrant experiences resulting from precarious livelihoods and discriminating migrant regimes. Linking anthropology with new area studies approaches, this book seeks to enhance multidisciplinary scholarship about the complex relation between religion, migration and mobile subjectivity in both Central Asian and Gulf studies and in the anthropology of Islam."-- Provided by publisher							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290991

290984	2	قيد التشكل : | ‏الشرق الأوسط بين تحولات النظام الدولي و التفاعلات الإقليمية /	فهمي، نبيل،	يأتي هذا الكتاب في ظل تغيرات متعددة وخطرة يمر بها العالم، غيرت التركيبة الجيوستراتيجية جوهرياً، وجعلت المجتمع الدولي يتحدث عن عالم متعدد الأقطاب والنزاعات والتحديات، متجاوزاً في ذلك فكرة استبدال روسيا والصين كقطب رئيسي آخر مع الولايات المتحدة، وتصورنا عالماً يحكمه العديد من الأقطاب، بما فيها بعض الدول المتوسطة، ويشارك في تشكيله حتى المؤسسات أو المنظمات غير الوطنية والخاصة.  ويتكون الكتاب من خمسة فصول، يتناول أولها الصراع بين القوى الكبرى على إعادة تشكيل النظام الدولي؛ إذ تتمسك واشنطن بهيمنتها على النظام الدولي منذ انتهاء الحرب الباردة، بينما تدفع روسيا والصين نحو تشكيل نظام متعدد الأقطاب، كما يتناول الحرب الروسية الأوكرانية باعتبارها أحد أشكال هذا الصراع، ونتائجها ستحدد شكل النظام الدولي، ويستعرض الفصل أيضاً ملامح النظام الدولي قيد التشكُّل.  ويستعرض الفصل الثاني مظاهر التنافس الدولي على منطقة الشرق الأوسط؛ من حيث تحولات الدور الأمريكي وتصاعد أدوار روسيا والصين بالمنطقة في محاولة لملء الفراغ الأمريكي، وتفاعل دول الشرق الأوسط مع هذا التنافس.  ثم يأتي الفصل الثالث ليستكشف التحولات في خريطة التفاعلات بين دول منطقة الشرق الأوسط، والتي ترسم ملامح النظام الشرق أوسطي الجديد، في انعكاس للتحول في قطبية النظام الدولي، ويسعى الفصل لتحديد موقع العرب في النظام الشرق أوسطي الجديد، وما يجب على الدول العربية ومؤسساتها الجماعية، وعلى رأسها الجامعة العربية، القيام به لتأمين مصالحها الوطنية والإقليمية.  فيما يتناول الفصل الرابع مشكلة الصراع العربي الإسرائيلي وتأثيراتها في منطقة الشرق الأوسط، بدءاً باستعراض محاولات إيجاد حل للقضية الفلسطينية في السنوات الأخيرة ومواقف الحكومات الإسرائيلية المتعاقبة منها؛ وصولاً إلى تفجر الصراع الفلسطيني الإسرائيلي عقب عملية "طوفان الأقصى" في السابع من أكتوبر 2023، ورد الأخيرة بعملية عسكرية واسعة النطاق في قطاع غزة، ويُقدم الفصل توصيات للفلسطينيين والعرب بشأن كيفية التعاطي مع التصعيد الإسرائيلي غير المسبوق في غزة.  وأخيراً، يطرح الفصل الخامس رؤية لنظام دولي أكثر عدالة وديمقراطية؛ يضمن حقوقاً متساوية لكافة الدول بما يحقق الصالح العام الجماعي، ويقترح خطوات لجعل منطقة الشرق الأوسط والعالم خالياً من الأسلحة النووية، كما يُقدم الفصل توصيات لصانع القرار العربي بشأن كيفية تعزيز دور الدول العربية في منطقة الشرق الأوسط، التي تشهد تغييرات مستمرة، بما يمكنها من تأمين مصالحها.  وقد خلص فهمي في كتابه إلى أن النظام الدولي يمر "بعاصفة مكتملة وعاتية"، وأن الشرق الأوسط "يعاد تشكيله"، وهذه التطورات مستمرة وممتدة ولم تتضح بعد معالمها الجديدة. ويرى فهمي أنه "ليس من المبالغة القول إننا الآن على حافة الهاوية في الحالتين، بين الإفاقة الدولية الصعبة والعاصفة بغية العودة إلى الرشد والحكمة بتبني مفاهيم تعاونية لنظام دولي يجمع الكل وينبني على توازن واقعي في المصالح، وأوضاع إقليمية شرق أوسطية بالغة الحساسية والخطورة تحتم تبني سياسات توافقية مع الحسم في ترجيح قوة القانون على قانون القوة والحق على الباطل".							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290984

290870	2	الدعاية الانتخابية و مشاركة الشباب في الانتخابات : | (التوجهات و التحولات) /	الزيدي، عبد اللطيف موفق لطيف،	في باكورة أعماله البحثية، يقدّم الإعلامي عبد اللطيف الزيدي كتاباً رصيناً بعنوان "الدعاية الانتخابية ومشاركة الشباب في الانتخابات: التوجهات والتحولات". يُعدّ هذا المؤلَّف مساهمة أكاديمية متميزة في حقل الإعلام السياسي، إذ يمزج بين العمل الميداني والتحليل النظري، متناولاً مشاركة الشباب العراقي، بوصفهم الفئة الأكثر تأثيراً وتفاعلاً في المجتمع، مع الخطاب الدعائي المصاحب للمشهد الانتخابي في العراق.  يركّز الزيدي في كتابه على تحقيق هدف بحثي مزدوج: فهم مدى تعرّض الشباب العراقي للدعاية الانتخابية التي تبثها القنوات التلفزيونية، واستكشاف الدوافع الكامنة وراء هذا التعرّض، إضافة إلى الإشباعات المتحققة لديهم جرّاء المتابعة. ويستند الباحث في معالجته المنهجية إلى نظرية "الاستخدامات والإشباعات"، التي وظّفها كإطار تحليلي لتقصّي العلاقة بين المتغيّرات الديموغرافية ومستوى التفاعل مع المحتوى الانتخابي. وقد اعتمد عيّنة من طلبة جامعة بغداد كنموذج تمثيلي لدراسة اتجاهات الشباب إزاء الحملات الدعائية الانتخابية.  كما يطرح المؤلف عدداً من الأسئلة البحثية التي تسعى إلى تعميق الفهم لسيكولوجيا الشباب الجامعي، مركزاً على سؤالين رئيسين: "ما الدوافع والإشباعات التي تتحقق من متابعة الدعاية الانتخابية عبر الفضائيات العراقية؟" و"ما دور هذه الدعاية في تحفيز الشباب الجامعي على المشاركة في العملية الانتخابية؟". وتنبثق من هذين السؤالين محاور بحثية ثرية تشكّل جوهر الدراسة.  ويقدّم الزيدي تمييزاً دقيقاً بين مفهومي "الحملة الانتخابية" بوصفها عملية منظمة تشمل إعداد البرامج واختيار المرشحين، و"الدعاية الانتخابية" بوصفها مفهوماً أشمل، يعنى بتوجيه الناخب وتكوين قناعاته وصولاً إلى قرار التصويت. كما يتناول المؤلف أبرز التعاريف النظرية لمفهوم الدعاية الانتخابية وفقاً لمدارس فكرية متعددة في فرنسا، والولايات المتحدة، وألمانيا، ما يضفي بعداً مقارناً على الدراسة.  وفي جهد توثيقي جدير بالتقدير، يستعرض الكاتب الأصول التاريخية للدعاية الانتخابية، منذ حضارة وادي الرافدين، مروراً بالتجارب الإغريقية والرومانية، وصولاً إلى الأنظمة الديمقراطية الحديثة في القرن الحادي والعشرين، مقدّماً بذلك سرداً تأريخياً ثرياً لتطور هذا المفهوم.  أما الفصل الثالث من الكتاب، والمعنون "دور الدعاية الانتخابية في الحث على المشاركة الجماهيرية", فيتناول إحدى القضايا الحيوية في الانتخابات العراقية الأخيرة، وهي العزوف الجماهيري عن المشاركة. ويحلّل الكاتب أسباب هذا العزوف، وكذلك دوافع المشاركة، مبرزاً خصوصية كل تجربة في تأثير الدعاية، سواء سلباً أو إيجاباً.  إنّ المعالجة المنهجية العميقة التي يقدّمها الزيدي في هذا العمل تضيف بعداً نوعياً للمكتبة الإعلامية العراقية، التي تفتقر إلى هذا النمط من الدراسات الميدانية الرصينة، ويُعدّ الكتاب مرجعاً مهماً للباحثين في مجال الإعلام والعلوم السياسية على حد سواء.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290870
290869	2	الحرب النفسية الحديثة : | فرع العمليات النفسية بالجيش الأمريكي نموذجا /	حمزاوي، ميلود،	يتناول كتاب "الحرب النفسية الحديثة: فرع العمليات النفسية بالجيش الأمريكي نموذجاً" تطور مفهوم الحرب النفسية وأهميتها المتزايدة في الاستراتيجيات العسكرية والسياسية للدول، مع التركيز على تجربة الجيش الأمريكي كنموذج رائد في هذا المجال. يوضح الكتاب كيف انتقلت الحرب النفسية من مجرد أداة لتعزيز الروح المعنوية إلى فرع عسكري متكامل، خاصة مع التحولات التكنولوجية والرقمية التي غيرت طبيعة الصراعات وجعلت الحرب النفسية استراتيجية أساسية، وأحياناً شاملة، في مواجهة التهديدات غير التقليدية والحروب الهجينة. كما يستعرض الكتاب نماذج تطبيقية مثل السيطرة الانعكاسية ونظرية التأطير، ويبين كيف أصبحت العمليات النفسية جزءاً لا يتجزأ من القوة الشاملة للدولة، تُستخدم ضد الأعداء كما قد تُوجه نحو الحلفاء أو المحايدين لتحقيق أهداف الدولة العليا. ويبرز الكتاب أن الولايات المتحدة طورت عقيدتها العسكرية باستمرار لتتلاءم مع التغيرات في طبيعة التهديدات، مستفيدة من التقدم في العلوم النفسية والاجتماعية، مما جعل العمليات النفسية أداة فعالة في التأثير على إدراك وسلوك الخصوم، وزعزعة معنوياتهم، وتحقيق النصر بأقل تكلفة ممكنة							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290869

290798	2	Political legitimacy in the United Arab Emirates : | foundations and development of a successful model /	Al-Nuaimi, Sultan Mohammed.,	Political legitimacy in the UAE is deeply rooted, reinforced by a rich cultural heritage, longstanding traditions, a centuries-old tribal framework and loyalty to the state and its leaders. This consensus-based legitimacy, founded on Emirati family ties, clans, tribes and tribal alliances, underpins a smooth and sustainable transfer of power from one generation to the next. It also forms the cornerstone of a socio-political system tailored to the UAE's identity and history, which advances the wellbeing of citizens and offers a model for nations with similar characteristics. The book begins by engaging with key concepts to provide a comprehensive understanding of legitimacy from both theoretical and practical perspectives, while retaining a focus on the Emirati context. The first chapter examines tribal ties, delving into the historical relationship to authority within Arab and Emirati tribal structures, before examining political development and the interplay between the tribe and modern state. The second chapter moves on to a discussion of contemporary tribalism, highlighting the successful evolution of tribal federalism in the UAE. The third chapter focuses on tribal forms of legitimacy and their incorporation within state legitimacy, which has been consolidated through continued achievement, social and economic progress, and political development. Together, these elements constitute a distinctive political model in the UAE, blending traditional values with contemporary governance to ensure lasting political legitimacy and progress for generations to come.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290798
290797	2	الصراع في منطقة المشرق العربي و أثره على النظام الدولي 2001-2020 م /	الطراونة، رأفت عبد السلام إلياس،	عند النظر للمسار التاريخي للحياة البشرية، نجد أن الصراع يمثل أحد أهم الحقائق الثبوتية في واقع الإنسان والجماعة على مختلف المستويات والأطر، حيث نجد في إطاره البيولوجي الصراع بين الأجناس والأفراد، والنفسية بما يعانيه الإنسان من صراع مع ذاته، والأثرياء في الصراع الثقافي، إضافة إلى الصراع الاقتصادي والسياسي وغير ذلك من أنماط الصراع المختلفة.  لقد بدأ القرن الحادي والعشرين بحرب أميركية على الإرهاب، بررتها أعمال الإرهاب التي حدثت في الولايات المتحدة عام 2001؛ لكن ساحات هذه الحرب وغيرها من القوى المشاركة فيها عميقة العديد من البلاد العربية والإسلامية، وهو ما زاد للذاكرة العربية ما حدث في مطلع القرن الماضي من استعمار وإحتلال وسيطرة أوروبية على المنطقة العربية، ومن تقسيم للأرض وللشعوب العربية، حيث أقيمت كيانات ودول متصارعة فيما يتعلق بالحدود، بينما هي أحق بأن تكون أمة واحدة ذات كيان سياسي واحد، كما هي أمة العالم الآخر  إن أهمية موضوع الصراع في أن السلم القومي الداخلي والخارجي ضروري لتحقيق أهداف التنمية الشاملة، إذ يعد الأساس في بناء نهضة الأمم المتحدة وتقدمها، لأنه من المحال تصور (وطن) في تنازع مع . ذاتي يستطيع التعايش بسلام مع غيره، حيث أن الأوطان الكثيرة المصائب قلما أن تتحكم فيها دولة، في ظل واقع ومستقبل الصراع الداخلي في العالم العربي الذي يشهد واقعا لا يرضي طموحات الأمة ولا ينسجم مع ماضي هذه الأمة.  إن التحالفات الدولية تمثل الركيزة الأساسية لتحقيق التوازن بين القوى الدولية، وفي الوقت نفسه من الممكن أن تتجه فيه تلك التحالفات نحو الصراع عند حدوث أي خلل حيث أن أحد أهم المنطلقات في تفسير صراع ظاهر، ما إذا كان الانضمام لحلف دولي هو دافع لحماية الأمن الومي في ظل بيئة تنازعية، فإن ذلك سيدفع الدول نحو زيادة القدرة العسكرية وبالتالي زيادة التوتر؛ ثم أن بقاء هذه التحالفات قد يدفع نحو الحفاظ على الأنظمة الداخلية للدول الأعضاء، وهو ما قد يتحول لصراع عند محاولة تغير هذه الأنظمة.  إن المشكلات الحقيقية المعقدة التي تواجه المشرق، هي الصراعات الداخلية العربية وفي محاولة منا سعينا لفهم واقع هذه الصراعات، حيث أن هذه الصراعات الداخلية لها كلفة واقعية وكبيرة على واقع هذه الدول بشكل خاص، وعلى مستقبل الدول العربية كوحدة كبرى تواجه العالم على الأقل أو يضعها العالم في موقع المواجهة، خاصة بعد الحملة الأميركية على الإرهاب العالمي الذي يضخ من هذه الدول بشكل عام على حد قولها.  وفي مراجعة شاملة لمعظم حالات الصراع الداخلي في العالم العربي، يتبن لنا وجود عدد كبير من الصراعات الداخلية يشمل ما يزيد عن نصف الدول العربية عددا وعن ثلثي هذه الدول مساحة وسكانا، والتي شملت الدول الفقيرة اقتصاديا وذات المواقع الإستراتيجية، والدول التي تشكل خط المواجهة مع الكيان الصهيوني. وبرز أن هناك تباينا في أسباب الصراعات الداخلية من دول إلى أخرى، كما وجدت موقعاً هاماً لنظرية المؤامرة في الفكر العربي الحديث التي هي من أساسيات تخلفنا، والتي تظهر عدم قدرتنا على تحمل المسؤولية التاريخية لأخطائنا، ومحاولة تحميل أعبائنا ومشكلاتنا على عوامل وظروف خارجة عن قدرتنا، فتبدو لنا الأمور وكأنه محكوم علينا بهذا الأمر حتى أصبحنا نطرب مفكرين وشعوباً وقيادات في حزننا الذي يلهينا ونطرب لأنغامه مؤمنين إن التواكل التاريخي سيعالج كل قضايانا.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290797

290560	2	العمل الدبلوماسي و أثره على عملية صنع القرار في السياسة الخارجية /‎	النعيمي، أحمد نوري،‎	تعد الدبلوماسية أحد الفروع الرئيسة لمادة العلاقات الدولية بصورة خاصة وعلم السياسة بصورة عامة، وقد غدا موضوعها واسعا متفرعا يثير الاهتمام والنقاش في أكثر من جانب، ويعزى السبب في ذلك إلى أهميته وطبيعته ذات الارتباط الوثيق بكثير من المواضيع التي تحتويها بقية فروع مادة علم السياسة، كالسياسة الخارجية، والقانون الدولي العام، والمنظمات الدولية، وغيرها من المواد ذات الصلة.  من هذا المنطلق، أنه من غير الصحيح أن تكون مادة الدبلوماسية منحصرة على الطلاب بالمدرجات والقاعات الجامعية، بل غدا موضوعها ذات اهتمام خانات أخرى من غير الوسط الجامعي. فهي بطبيعة الحال محل اهتمام رجالات الدبلوماسية وصناع عملية صنع القرار في السياسة الخارجية، فضلا عن اهتمامات الإعلاميين ودارمي مادة السياسة الخارجية وحركية التفاعل الدولي. وتجدر الإشارة في هذا المجال، أن كثيرا من الوحدات الدولية بدأت الأخذ بنظر الاعتبار بربط مراكز الدراسات السياسية والإستراتيجية بوزارات الخارجية لتحقيق وظيفة مزدوجة تدريب وتأهيل ملاكات السلك الدبلوماسي والسعي على تطوير أدوات البحث العلمي المرتبط بالأداة الدبلوماسية.  ابتداء، لابد من إثارة السؤال الآتي: لماذا هذا الاهتمام من دراسة الدبلوماسية في جامعاتنا؟ من بين الأسباب العديدة لدراسة الدبلوماسية ظهر الدافع الأهم وتطور في القرون القليلة الماضية بالتناغم مع تطور الدبلوماسية الحديثة نفسها، كما ظهر سبب مهم في السنوات الأخيرة ولعل أهم سبب تقليدي لدراستها كان سببا مهنيا ألا وهو الإعداد للممارسة في الميدان الدبلوماسي، كما أن الكتابات الحديثة نسبيا عنالدبلوماسية مثل كتاب " ويكفورت " السفير ومهامه " والذي طبع في عام 1681 وكتاب دي كاليري والموسوم ب " على طريقة المفاوض " في عام 1697، هذان الكتابان كان الهدف منهما إعطاء القراء الخلفية التاريخية والتجريبية التي يحتاجونها لكي يصبحوا مفاوضين أكفاء ولما تطور نظام الدولة منذ القرن السادس عشر وتطورت معه الحاجة إلى علاقات دبلوماسية بين الدول ازداد الطلب على دبلوماسيين محترفين لتولي مناصب وزراء الخارجية ثم تبعه ظهور العديد من المؤلفات بشأن عملية التفاوض التي تعد محور العمل الدبلوماسي، وفي كتابه الشهير الدبلوماسية النظرية والتطبيق " يخصص جيفري بيريدج النصف الأول من الكتاب لفن التفاوض.  يعد السبب الثاني والأحدث لدراسة الدبلوماسية أكثر أكاديمية وعمومية من السبب الأول. فمع بداية النصف الأول من القرن العشرين أصبحت الدبلوماسية تفهم بشكل أوسع من مجرد عملية تمثيل الدولة والتفاوض نيابة عنها حيث بدأ العلماء في النصف الأول من القرن في دراسة الدبلوماسية على أنها وسيلة لفهم ما أصبح يعرف في ذلك الوقت بالعلاقات الدولية العلاقات بين الدول في النظام العالمي، وكذلك خصائص النظام الدولي للأمم نفسه، ولقد حدث هذا جزئيا بسبب الحاجة التي شعر بها العلماء لفهم أسباب الحرب العالمية الأولى والعمليات المترتبة عليها لخلق كيانات ومؤسسات صممت من أجل منع تكرار النتائج المدمرة للحرب بغية إنهاء كل الحروب هل باستطاعة الفهم الواعي للممثلين الدبلوماسيين والعمليات الدبلوماسية وبالتالي يقلل من احتمال الحروب المستقبلية ؟ ربما، ولكن في الوقت نفسه ازداد الاهتمام بدلوماسية مواطني الدول التي تأثر مصيرها بفعل دبلوماسييها وكان له نتائج مذهلة في عصر ظهرت فيه أسلحة الدمار الشامل.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290560

290471	2	Urban warfare in the twenty-first century /	King, Anthony,	War is urbanizing. From Mosul to Mumbai, Aleppo to Marawi, the largest and most intense battles of the twenty-first century have taken place in densely populated urban areas. In the Ukraine War, Russian and Ukrainian troops have converged on urban areas, including Kyiv, Mariupol and Bakhmut, to fight brutal attritional sieges. Meanwhile the battle of Gaza rages. Through a close analysis of recent urban conflicts and their historical antecedents, sociologist Anthony King explores the changing urban battlescape. Whilst many tactics used in urban warfare are not new, he shows how operations in cities today have coalesced into localized micro-sieges, which extend from street level and below to the airspace high above the city, as combatants fight for individual buildings, streets and districts. At the same time, digitalized social media and information networks communicate battles to global audiences across an urban archipelago, with these spectators often becoming active participants in the fight. Fully revised and updated to include detailed examples from Ukraine and Gaza illustrating the anatomy of twenty-first-century urban warfare, the second edition of this popular text is a timely reminder of the costs and the horror of war and violence in cities --							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290471
290470	2	التيارات السياسية في الخليج العربي /	العقاد، صلاح،	يتناول كتاب "التيارات السياسية في الخليج العربي" للدكتور صلاح العقاد دراسة معمقة لطبيعة التحولات السياسية والاجتماعية التي شهدتها منطقة الخليج العربي منذ بدايات العصور الحديثة وحتى العقود الأخيرة، مع التركيز على العوامل الداخلية والخارجية التي أسهمت في بلورة التيارات السياسية المختلفة. يستعرض المؤلف جذور التغيرات السياسية في المنطقة، ويحلل تأثير الاستعمار الأوروبي، خاصة البريطاني، في تشكيل البنية السياسية والاجتماعية لدول الخليج، إلى جانب الدور الذي لعبته القوى الإقليمية مثل الدولة العثمانية وفارس في التنافس على النفوذ. كما يتطرق الكتاب إلى نشأة الحركات الوطنية والقومية والدينية، ويبرز كيف تفاعلت هذه التيارات مع التحديات الاقتصادية والاجتماعية، مثل اكتشاف النفط والتحولات الديموغرافية، وصولاً إلى بروز تيارات سياسية معاصرة ذات طابع إسلامي أو ليبرالي. ويولي العقاد اهتماماً خاصاً بتأثير العوامل الخارجية، مثل السياسات الغربية والصراعات الإقليمية، على مسار التيارات السياسية المحلية، ويعرض تحليلاً لتأثير هذه التيارات على الاستقرار السياسي والاجتماعي ومستقبل دول الخليج. يمزج الكتاب بين السرد التاريخي والتحليل السياسي، ليقدم رؤية شاملة عن ديناميات التغيير السياسي في الخليج العربي، ويوضح كيف أن التيارات السياسية هناك هي نتاج تفاعل معقد بين الداخل والخارج، وبين التقليد والحداثة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290470

290468	2	Russia and Ukraine : | entangled histories, diverging states /	Popova, Maria,	In February 2022, Russian missiles rained on Ukrainian cities, and tanks rolled towards Kyiv to end Ukrainian independent statehood. President Zelensky declined a Western evacuation offer and Ukrainians rallied to defend their country. What are the roots of this war, which has upended the international legal order and brought back the spectre of nuclear escalation? How did these supposedly "brotherly peoples" become each other's worst nightmare? In Russia and Ukraine: Entangled Histories, Diverging States, Maria Popova and Oxana Shevel explain how since 1991 Russia and Ukraine diverged politically, ending up on a collision course. Russia slid back into authoritarianism and imperialism, while Ukraine consolidated a competitive political system and pro-European identity. As Ukraine built a democratic nation-state, Russia refused to accept it and came to see it as an "anti-Russia" project. After political and economic pressure proved ineffective, and even counterproductive, Putin went to war to force Ukraine back into the fold of the "Russian world." Ukraine resisted, determined to pursue European integration as a sovereign state. These irreconcilable goals, rather than geopolitical wrangling between Russia and the West over NATO expansion, are - the authors argue - essential to understanding Russia's war on Ukraine." --							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290468
290467	2	Age of revolutions : | progress and backlash from 1600 to the present /	Zakaria, Fareed,	"The CNN host and best-selling author explores the revolutions--past and present--that define the polarized and unstable age in which we live.   Populist rage, ideological fracture, economic and technological shocks, war, and an international system studded with catastrophic risk--the early decades of the twenty-first century may be the most revolutionary period in modern history. But it is not the first. Humans have lived, and thrived, through more than one great realignment. What are these revolutions, and how can they help us to understand our fraught world?   In this major work, Fareed Zakaria masterfully investigates the eras and movements that have shaken norms while shaping the modern world. Three such periods hold profound lessons for today. First, in the seventeenth-century Netherlands, a fascinating series of transformations made that tiny land the richest in the world--and created politics as we know it today. Next, the French Revolution, an explosive era that devoured its ideological children and left a bloody legacy that haunts us today. Finally, the mother of all revolutions, the Industrial Revolution, which catapulted Great Britain and the US to global dominance and created the modern world.  Alongside these paradigm-shifting historical events, Zakaria probes four present-day revolutions: globalization, technology, identity, and geopolitics. For all their benefits, the globalization and technology revolutions have produced profound disruptions and pervasive anxiety and our identity. And increasingly, identity is the battlefield on which the twenty-first century's polarized politics are fought. All this is set against a geopolitical revolution as great as the one that catapulted the United States to world power in the late nineteenth century. Now we are entering a world in which the US is no longer the dominant power. As we find ourselves at the nexus of four seismic revolutions, we can easily imagine a dark future. But Zakaria proves that pessimism is premature. If we act wisely, the liberal international order can be revived and populism relegated to the ash heap of history.   As few public intellectuals can, Zakaria combines intellectual range, deep historical insight, and uncanny prescience to once again reframe and illuminate our turbulent present. His bold, compelling arguments make this book essential reading in our age of revolutions."--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290467

290460	2	كل شيء كسلاح : | دليل ميداني للحرب في القرن الحادي و العشرين /	جاليوتي، مارك،	في يومنا هذا، أصبحت الحروب التقليدية — التي تُخاض بالبنادق والقنابل والطائرات المسيّرة — باهظة التكلفة للغاية، وغير محبّذة لدى الشعوب، وصعبة الإدارة. في عصرٍ تلوّح فيه أمريكا بالعقوبات ضد أوروبا، وتنفق فيه الصين مليارات الدولارات لشراء النفوذ في الخارج، يتجه العالم نحو عصرٍ جديد من الصراعات الدائمة منخفضة الحدّة، والتي غالبًا ما تمر دون ملاحظة، ودون إعلان، ودون نهاية. يقدّم خبير الجريمة العابرة للحدود مارك غاليوني دراسة شاملة ورائدة حول هذا الشكل الجديد من الحروب. ومن خلال جولة عالمية، يُظهر غاليوني كيف تُخاض صراعات اليوم باستخدام كل شيء من المعلومات المضللة والتجسس، إلى الجريمة والتخريب، ما يؤدي إلى زعزعة الاستقرار داخل الدول وأزمة شرعية على مستوى العالم. لكنه، بدلاً من أن يقترح الأمل بعودة إلى عصرٍ مضى من "الحرب المستقرة"، يشرح سبل البقاء والتكيّف والاستفادة من الفرص التي يتيحها هذا الواقع الجديد." ¦ يقدم الكتاب، الصادر في عام 2023 ، نظرة عامة وواضحة، على نحو مثير للإعجاب، لأشكال الصراع الغامضة والعصية على الفهم. إذ توصف هذه المساحة بالحروب الهجينة أو حروب المنطقة الرمادية أو الحروب منخفضة الكثافة؛ وهي المنطقة غير المحددة بين العلاقات السلمية والحرب المعلنة.    فقد أضحت الصراعات التقليدية، التي يُخاض فيها القتال بالبنادق والمدافع والطائرات المُسيَّرة، أكثر تكلفة ولا تحظى بالشعبية في الداخل وتستعصي على الإدارة. وفي العصر الذي تهدد فيه الولايات المتحدة دول أخرى بالعقوبات، وتنفق الصين المليارات لشراء النفوذ في الخارج، يتجه العالم نحو عصر جديد من الصراعات الدائمة منخفضة الكثافة، غير الملحوظة وغير المعلنة وغير المنتهية في أغلب الأحوال.   ومع عودة الصراعات إلى أوروبا مرة أخرى في ظل الصراع في شرق أوروبا وأوكرانيا، يقدم غاليوتي مسحاً شاملاً وجديداً لأدوات الحرب الجديدة، من خلال إلقاء نظرة فاحصة على مختلف مناطق العالم، وكذلك الحقب التاريخية من العالم القديم حتى عصرنا الحالي. ويوضح الطرق التي تُخاض بها صراعات العالم، حيث يُستخدم كل شيء كسلاح، بدايةً من عمليات التضليل والتجسس والجريمة والتخريب، ما يؤدي إلى نشر الاضطرابات داخل الدول. وبدلاً من التعويل على العودة إلى ما فات من "عالم مستقر ومعروف ويقيني"، يشرح غاليوتي طرق البقاء والتكيف، بل واستغلال الفرص التي يقدمها الواقع الجديد.   ويقول غاليوتي إن هذا الكتاب ليس تنبؤاً بالمستقبل، بل مقدمة لمسار مستقبلي مُحتمل، حيث نبهتنا جائحة "كورونا" إلى أننا في الحياة نصطدم بأمواج غير متوقعة قد تغير العالم بأكمله. وقد يكون من السهل اعتبار المستقبل المقصود هنا واقعاً مريراً الصراع فيه أبدي، ويمكن استخدام كل شيء فيه من أعمال خيرية إلى القانون كسلاح.   ولا يعني هذا أن صراعات المستقبل ستكون دون إراقة دماء، حيث يموت الناس جراء العقوبات الاقتصادية، والمعلومات المضللة المناهضة للقاحات، والفساد في ميزانية الصحة أيضاً؛ ولكنها أقل دموية، إذ تصبح الحروب المباشرة بين دولة وأخرى خروجاً عن السائد. وقد يكون عالماً يستطيع فيه الأخيار استخدام الأدوات نفسها بفاعلية كما يفعل الأشرار إن وحدوا جهودهم. ففي التفاعلات الجيوسياسية، كلُ يخدم مصالحه الخاصة، ونادراً ما يكون أحد خيراً أو شريراً كلياً؛ بل يتنوع القبح بين الناس.  ويهدف الكتاب، كما يذكر غاليوتي، إلى تعزيز القدرات التكيفية للمجتمعات الغربية على حروب المستقبل التي تشمل كل شيء تقريباً. وبدلاً من التعويل على عودة العالم اليقيني والمعروف والمستقر، ثمة طرق للبقاء والتكيف وتعزيز فرص الاستفادة من طرق الحرب الجديدة. وتشمل وسائل التكيف، ضرورة سعي الحكومات الغربية لمحو أمية وسائل الإعلام الجديدة والمنصات التي تشيع من خلالها وسائل التضليل والمعلومات الزائفة. كذلك، من المهم قطع الطريق على الجماعات الإجرامية الصغيرة التي تستغل احتياجات بعض التجمعات والمجتمعات الصغيرة وتكون من خلالها شبكات الإجرام والإرهاب والتهريب والتزييف وغيرها من سُبل تقويض الاستقرار. ويشير غاليوتي أيضاً إلى أنه لا مفر من تعزيز الديمقراطيات الغربية وإعادة بث الثقة في مكوناتها الرئيسية، وإعادة تشكيل "الشرعية الشعبية" التي تقوم عليها هذه الديمقراطيات.   ويؤكد غاليوتي أنه بعيداً عن الصراعات العسكرية الصريحة، أصبح الفارق بين الحرب والسلام، والنصر والهزيمة، ضبابياً. فثمة انتصارات وليس نصراً واحداً، وهناك تصعيد للتنافس وتخفيف من التصعيد من حيث المستوى والجدية. وثمة تعريفات جديدة تماماً للقوة، حيث تعتمد القوة في أي نوع من الصراعات على استخدام الأدوات المناسبة والإصرار على توظيفها. وإذا أصبحت الصراعات المتزايدة هي صراعات على النفوذ والعلاقات واستعراض القوى الاقتصادية والتلاعب السري، فإن هناك مؤشرات قوة جديدة أكثر أهمية.   الجدير بالذكر أن مؤلف الكتاب غاليوتي هو باحث ومؤرخ بريطاني متخصص في الشؤون الأمنية الروسية والجريمة العابرة للحدود. ويدير شركة "مايك للاستخبارات"، وهو أستاذ شرفي بكلية الدراسات السلافية ودراسات شرق أوروبا بجامعة لندن، كما أنه زميل للمعهد الملكي للخدمات المتحدة في لندن، ومعهد الشرق الأوسط في واشنطن. وصدرت له العديد من الكتب والدراسات حول تاريخ روسيا والنظام السياسي الروسي والجريمة المنظمة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290460

290454	2	الهجانة في تشكل الأحزاب السياسية الحديثة : | المجال العربي أنموذجا /	أشتي، فارس،	للأحزاب أهمية بالغة في السياسة، مثالها الأعلى تلك التي قامت على قواعد الثورة الصناعية والرأسمالية في بريطانيا وفرنسا والولايات المتحدة الأميركية، والتي عُمم أنموذجها في العالمَين الثالث والعربي بين نهاية القرن التاسع عشر ومطلع القرن العشرين، وقد سار على هدي ذلك الأنموذج باحثون كَتَبوا عن الأحزاب في بلداننا. لكنّ التقدُّم بالمجال السياسي العام لم ينجح خلال قرن ونيّف مع الأحزاب العربية، التي تراجع حضورها وتشظَّتْ، مع ردِّ محللين ذلك إلى بُعدها عما أُسِّست عليه من مبادئ، وآخرين إلى تخلُّف البنى المجتمعية العربية، وفريق ثالث منهم إلى مجافاتها الأنموذج الغربي الرأسمالي الحديث. يواجه كتاب، الهجانة في تشكّل الأحزاب السياسية الحديثة – الأحزاب العربية أنموذجًا، واقعَ الأحزاب العربية المأزوم، بوصفه مثالًا للبلدان خارج المركز الرأسمالي، عبر عرض إشكاليةٍ فيه تُعارِض حتى تشكّل الأحزاب في البنى المجتمعية الهجينة مقارنة بتشكُّلها في العالم الغربي، منطلِقًا من فرضية اختلاف المحددات البنيوية لتكوين الحزب العربي بعد النصف الثاني من القرن التاسع عشر عما هي عليه في الدول الحديثة، وهجانة هذه المحددات مجتمعيًّا ودولتيًّا. لقد أسس الحزب السياسي الحديث بنيانه على الانتقال بالعلاقات الاجتماعية في الإنتاج الزراعي إلى أخرى في ظل الإنتاج الصناعي، أساسها الرأسمالية ومواجهة الإقطاع والإمبراطوريات، وتشكيل دول قومية أرسى مؤتمر وستفاليا (1648) حدودها، وأتيح فيها للقوى المجتمعية تشكيل أحزابها، التي لم تتضارب محدداتها مع التطورات العلمية والتكنولوجية إلا شيئًا يسيرًا في ما خصَّ الدولة السيدة وحكم القانون وإنتاج السلطة من الشعب في مقابل العلاقات الرأسمالية والمعرفة العلمية. استقبلت البنى المجتمعية في البلدان العربية، على حين غرة، فكرة الحزب السياسي الحديث المكتمِل التشكل في بيئات زراعية في معظمها ومجال سياسي متشظٍّ بين سلطات أبوية ونبوية وأوتوقراطية محكومة بالولاء والتبعية والاستبداد. فلم يؤدِّ الانخراط الإمبريالي في الاقتصاد والسياسة والعسكر، منذ تفكك الإمبراطورية العثمانية، إلى تعزيز الإنتاج وتحديثه وبناء دول قومية حديثة، بل اقتصر على تعزيز التبادل التجاري والتحديث الخدماتي وقيام إمارات تؤمّن مقتضيات توسع الطرف المسيطر. وحتى دول ما بعد الاستقلال وحركاته الحاكمة لم تفلح في بناء دول حديثة وإنتاج صناعي واقتصاد حديث ومستقل، بل غالت في تعزيز سلطتها بذريعة تحرير فلسطين، وشرذمت العلاقات الاجتماعية بين الولاءات للسلطة وعدمها، وكرّست التبعية على قاعدة خدمتية. ركز الكتاب، خلال معالجته إشكالية الهجانة في الأحزاب العربية، على الأدبيات الأجنبية في علوم السياسة والسوسيولوجيا والتاريخ عن تشكّل الأحزاب السياسية المتفاوتة المناهج، ثم مقارنتها بالأدبيات العربية التراثية والحديثة، لمحاولة إظهار تصورِ كلٍّ منهما لمفهوم الحزب وتشكله. وتتبع الكتاب بالدرس كذلك تفاعل الأحزاب العربية لدى احتكاكها بالوافد الرأسمالي، والمفاهيم التي أفرزتها عن الدولة، والبنية المجتمعية، والإمرة، والنخب، والحقل السياسي، والهدف، والحامل الاجتماعي، والبشر، والتنظيم، والفاعلية. وتتبع الكتاب أيضًا مراحل تشكل الأحزاب السياسية الحديثة الخمس في المركز الرأسمالي (بزوغ الأحزاب الحديثة، صعود الأحزاب، استواء العمل الحزبي والتعددية الحزبية، التشكيك في الأحزاب، تراجع الأحزاب)، والأربع في المجال العربي (أحزاب الوجهاء، الأحزاب المتجاوزة، الأحزاب في السلطة، الأحزاب في التخبط). وشرح بالتفصيل مكونات الأحزاب، من حيث البيئة المجتمعية التي تنتجها ومن حيث ما يتجاوزها، وبيَّن الهجَانة السياسية والفكرية والمجتمعية في تشكل الأحزاب السياسية العربية، منتقيًا أنموذجَين منها هما حزب البعث العربي الاشتراكي والحزب الشيوعي اللبناني (معتبرًا إياه ممثِّلًا عن الأحزاب الشيوعية العربية).							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290454

290440	2	تاريخ العلاقات السياسية و الاقتصادية بين العراق و منطقة الخليج العربي /	المسري، حسين علي،	وتشير الدلائل على أن منطقة الخليج العربي شاركت مشاركة فاعلة في البناء الحضاري للعالم قبل ظهور الإسلام وفي ظل الإسلام. وهو يشغل موقعا استراتيجيا مرموقا بين طرق التجارة العالمية، فعن طريقه كان يتم تبادل السلع التجارية بين الشرق والغرب عبر حقب التاريخ، وهو بذلك الشريان الذي كان يزود العالم القديم والوسيط بسلع الشرق فضلا عن خبراته الاقتصادية الوفيرة من لآلى بحرية ومعادن وفيرة. وبانتقال حاضرة الخلافة من دمشق إلى بغداد ازدادت الأهمية التجارية لهذا الخليج، وترتب على ذلك انتقال الأهمية التجارية من البحر المتوسط إلى الخليج العربي، فعن طريقه كانت تصدر معظم السلع التجارية التي تحتاج إليها الخلافة العباسية وبذلك ازدهرت الحياة الاقتصادية في الأقطار المطلة على سواحله، وظهرت نتيجة لذلك بعض المدن التجارية التي كان لها دور بارز في نقل السلع التجارية بين الشرق والغرب، من أمثلها، دارين في البحرين وصحار على ساخل خليج عمان وسيراف والقطيف تقع على الساحل الغربي للخليج العربي. أبرز البلدانيون والرحالة المسلمون القدامى في كتاباتهم عن الخليج العربي أهميته الجغرافية الاقتصادية، فتحدثوا عن ثرواته المعدنية والحيوانية، وعن الهجرات البشرية التي استقرت على سواحله، وعن جزره وعن الأراضي المحيطة به كما كتبوا عن طوله وعرضه وعمق مياهه وعن الأوقات المناسبة للإبحار فيه. فمن أقوالهم عن هذا الخليج، إجماعهم تقريباً على أنه يستمد مياهه من البحر المحيط، وقولهم: إن الخليج العربي فرع من البحر المحيط ، ويذكر ابن رستة أبو علي أحمد بن عمر (توفي في أوائل القرن الرابع الهجري)، أن عدد البحار التي تخرج من هذا المحيط خمسة أبحر ، ويقول الاصطخري أبو إسحاق إبراهيم بن فارس (توفي ٣٤٤هـ ، ٩٥٩م) إن أعظم هذه البحار بحر فارس، أي الخليج العربي، ثم يليه بحر الروم أي البحر المتوسط.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290440

290359	2	الكوابح و المحفزات : | حروب الشرق الأوسط /		كتاب "الكوابح والمحفزات: حروب الشرق الأوسط" يُقدّم رؤية تحليلية معمقة للصراعات المتكررة في منطقة الشرق الأوسط من خلال دراسة العوامل التي تؤدي إلى اندلاع الحروب أو تجنبها. يستعرض المؤلف محركات النزاعات مثل الطائفية، الصراع على الموارد، التدخلات الأجنبية، والانقسامات الأيديولوجية، ويقابلها بمجموعة من الكوابح التي يمكن أن تحد من الانفجار مثل التوازنات الإقليمية، الردع العسكري، والضغوط الدبلوماسية الدولية. كما يناقش الكتاب نماذج لحروب شهيرة في المنطقة ويوضح كيف أن بعض النزاعات كان من الممكن تفاديها لو تم تفعيل أدوات الردع والتسوية السياسية بشكل مبكر. يقدم المؤلف تحليلاً دقيقًا للبيئة الاستراتيجية التي تتحكم بسلوك الدول الفاعلة في المنطقة، معتمدًا على مصادر تاريخية وبيانات معاصرة، ما يجعل الكتاب مرجعًا مهمًا لفهم ديناميكيات الصراع والسلام في الشرق الأوسط.  ويمتاز الكتاب بتقديم رؤية تحليلية عابرة للحدود الوطنية، حيث يتعامل مع الشرق الأوسط كوحدة جيوسياسية مترابطة، تتأثر أزماته ببعضها البعض. ويخلص المؤلف إلى أن فهم طبيعة التفاعل بين الكوابح والمحفزات هو مفتاح رئيسي لفهم ديناميكيات الحرب والسلام في المنطقة، معتبرًا أن الحلول لا تكمن فقط في الردع العسكري أو الإصلاح الداخلي، بل تتطلب كذلك توافقات إقليمية ودولية أكثر شمولًا. ¦ تقوم الفكرة الرئيسية للكتاب على تشخيص دورات التصعيد، وحالة عدم الاستقرار الممتدة في الشرق الأوسط، وكيف أصبح الإقليم ينتقل من دورة تصعيد إلى دورة تالية من دون المرور بمرحلة تبريد تقود إلى الاستقرار قبل الدخول في دورة التصعيد التالية، وهو ما يعود إلى أن محفزات حالة عدم الاستقرار باتت أكبر من الكوابح، التي يمكن أن توقفها أو تعمل على خفض التصعيد، تمهيداً لبدء عملية سياسية. وانطلاقاً من هذه الفكرة الرئيسية، هناك ست أفكار فرعية موزعة على فصول الكتاب، يتناولها المشاركون بشكل تفصيلي.       ففي الفصل الأول من الكتاب، الذي يتناول بشكل رئيسي أبعاد اللحظة الإقليمية الحالية، ويأتي تحت عنوان (لحظة حرجة: إلى أين يتجه الشرق الأوسط؟)، يشخص محرر الكتاب أحمد عليبه، الحالة الأمنية في الشرق الأوسط، في إطار مقاربة الحروب والصراعات التي يشهدها الإقليم، والانتقال من متوالية الأزمات إلى الانفجار المتسلسل. كما يشير إلى أن الإقليم في حالة ذروة انتشار عسكري طارئة كاستجابة للأوضاع الأمنية، لكنها قد تتحول إلى حالة مستدامة في إطار استراتيجيات الانتشار الدولي والإقليمي في إطار خريطة التنافس الجيوسياسي، كما يوزع المحرر خريطة إعادة تشكل مراكز القوة الإقليمية بين أربع كتل رئيسية في الإقليم تتعاطى مع التطورات الراهنة، وهي: قوى الحرب، وتحالفات الدفاع، وكتلة الاتزان الإقليمي، ومجموعة المتضررين. ثم ينتقل بعد ذلك إلى تناول الصراع على تشكيل شرق أوسط جديد.   وفي الفصل الثاني، ترسم هبة القدسي، الصحافية والباحثة المتخصصة في الشؤون الأمريكية ومدير مكتب صحيفة الشرق الأوسط في واشنطن، فكرتها الرئيسية حول المنظور الأمريكي للإقليم انطلاقاً من عنوان كاشف، وهو "استراتيجية اللاستراتيجية: سياسات واشنطن تجاه الشرق الأوسط" وتستعرض فيه تصوراً شاملاً وجمعياً للسياسات الأمنية والدبلوماسية تجاه الشرق الأوسط، وتشير القدسي إلى أن الأدوات الأمريكية في التعامل مع الشرق الأوسط تنوعت عبر الإدارات الديمقراطية والجمهورية، إلا أنها ركزت على إدارتي الرئيس دونالد ترامب، الجمهورية السابقة، والإدارة الحالية للرئيس جو بايدن، من منظور أنهما سيخوضان انتخابات الرئاسة الأمريكية 2024؛ وهو العام الأكثر سخونة في تحولات الشرق الأوسط. وسلطت الضوء على فكرة مفادها، أنه من الصعوبة بمكان تقلص النفوذ الأمريكي في الشرق الأوسط، وأن الأمر لا يخضع لرغبات الإدارات؛ لأن المنطقة تفرض نفسها على الأجندة الأمريكية.    وفي الفصل الثالث، يقدم سعيد عكاشة، الخبير في مركز الأهرام للدراسات السياسية والاستراتيجية تشريحاً تفصيلياً لمتغير عقيدة الأمن القومي الإسرائيلي ما بعد هجمات 7 أكتوبر2023، وينطلق من أن هناك اعترافاً من جانب النخبة في إسرائيل بانهيار عقيدة الأمن القومي الإسرائيلي بمكوناتها التقليدية؛ ويقدم تصوراً حول ما يدور في الداخل الإسرائيلي من تصورات؛ ستشكل ملامح مستقبل التغير في عقيدة الأمن القومي، والعقيدة القتالية.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290359

After the devastation of World War Two the international community united to enshrine fundamental rights to refuge, health, education and living standards. They protected privacy, fair trials and free speech and outlawed torture, slavery and discrimination. Their goal was greater global justice, equality and peace. That settlement is now under attack from opponents on both left and right and populist and authoritarian movements worldwide. Simultaneously, we are threatened by war, inequality, new tech and climate catastrophe, crises human rights can help us address. In this urgent, powerful book, Shami Chakrabarti, demonstrates why human rights matter and why we need to secure further rights to deal with challenges of the present and future. Outlining the historic national and international struggles for human rights, from ancient Babylon to the present day, Chakrabarti is an indispensable guide to the law and logic underpinning human dignity and universal freedoms. This book equips supporters in the battle of ideas and will encourage doubters to think again. To believe in human rights is to believe in human beings.

Unlike Rockefeller's empire, however, Bezos's company had grown voraciously without much scrutiny. In fact, for over twenty years, Amazon had emerged as a Wall Street darling and its "customer obsession" approach made it indelibly attractive to consumers across the globe. But the company was not benevolent; it operated in ways that ensured it stayed on top. Lina Khan's paper would light a fire in Washington, and in a matter of years, she would become the head of the FTC.

290290	2	Islam and the Arab revolutions : | the ulama between democracy and autocracy /	Al-Azami, Usaama,	The Arab revolutions of 2011 were a transformative moment in the modern history of the Middle East, as people rose up against long-standing autocrats throughout the region to call for 'bread, freedom and dignity'. With the passage of time, results have been decidedly mixed, with tentative success stories like Tunisia contrasting with the emergence of even more repressive dictatorships in places like Egypt, with the backing of several Gulf states. Focusing primarily on Egypt, this book considers a relatively understudied dimension of these the role of prominent religious scholars. While pro-revolutionary ulama have justified activism against authoritarian regimes, counter-revolutionary scholars have provided religious backing for repression, and in some cases the mass murder of unarmed protestors. Usaama al-Azami traces the public engagements and religious pronouncements of several prominent ulama in the region, including Yusuf al-Qaradawi, Ali Gomaa and Abdullah bin Bayyah, to explore their role in either championing the Arab revolutions or supporting their repression. He concludes that while a minority of noted scholars have enthusiastically endorsed the counter-revolutions, their approach is attributable less to premodern theology and more to their distinctly modern commitment to the authoritarian state.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290290

Resolving the impasse demands we understand how it began. In 1943, America declared that Japanese-held Taiwan would return to China at the conclusion of World War II. The Chinese civil war led to a change of plans. The Communist Party came to power in China and the defeated Nationalist leader, Chiang Kai-shek, fled to Taiwan, where he was afforded US protection. The specter of conflict has loomed ever since. In The Struggle for Taiwan, Sulmaan Wasif Khan offers the first comprehensive history of the triangular relationship between the United States, China, and Taiwan, exploring America's ambivalent commitment to Taiwan's defense, China's bitterness about the separation, and Taiwan's impressive transformation into a flourishing democracy. War is not inevitable, Khan shows, but to avoid it, decision-makers must heed the lessons of the past. From the White Terror to the Taiwan Straits Crises, from the normalization of Sino-American relations to Trump-era rising tensions, The Struggle for Taiwan charts the paths to our present predicament to show what futures might be possible"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290289

290285	2	An American first approach to U.S. national security /		U.S. national security is a subject that has been under intense scrutiny since the end of the Cold War. What constitutes such security for the United States as this country approaches the new century? Are the ends, ways, and means of our national security and national military strategies sufficient to provide for the nation's future? And above all, as this country celebrates the 50th anniversary of the National Security Act of 1947, are the institutions that resulted from that act still sufficient for the post-Cold War era? With these questions in mind, the Strategic Studies Institute and Dickinson College's Clarke Center co-sponsored the series of lectures on American national security after the Cold War which are contained in this volume. The lectures take four different, yet complementary, perspectives. Professor Ronald Steel reminds us of the intellectual revolution embodied in the act that moved America from the concept of "defense" to one of "national security" and relates this concept to our attempts to define post-Cold War national security interests. Dr. Lawrence Korb reviews the evolution in our national security establishment since the 1947 act. Dr. Morton Halperin's focus is the continuing tension between secrecy in the name of national security and the openness required in a democratic society, with a commentary on continuing threats to civil liberties. In the concluding essay, Ambassador Robert Ellsworth surveys the key strategic challenges facing the United States as we enter the 21st century.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290285

290270	2	Autocracy, Inc. : | the dictators who want to run the world /	Applebaum, Anne,	"From the Pulitzer-prize winning, New York Times bestselling author, an alarming account of how autocracies work together to undermine the democratic world, and how we should organize to defeat them We think we know what an autocratic state looks like: There is an all-powerful leader at the top. He controls the police. The police threaten the people with violence. There are evil collaborators, and maybe some brave dissidents. But in the 21st century, that bears little resemblance to reality. Nowadays, autocracies are underpinned not by one dictator, but by sophisticated networks composed of kleptocratic financial structures, surveillance technologies, and professional propagandists, all of which operate across multiple regimes, from China to Russia to Iran. Corrupt companies in one country do business with corrupt companies in another. The police in one country can arm and train the police in another, and propagandists share resources and themes, pounding home the same messages about the weakness of democracy and the evil of America. International condemnation and economic sanctions cannot move the autocrats. Even popular opposition movements, from Venezuela to Hong Kong to Moscow, don't stand a chance. The members of Autocracy, Inc, aren't linked by a unifying ideology, like communism, but rather a common desire for power, wealth, and impunity. In this urgent treatise, which evokes George Kennan's essay calling for "containment" of the Soviet Union, Anne Applebaum calls for the democracies to fundamentally reorient their policies to fight a new kind of threat"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290270
290269	2	How AI thinks: | how we built it, how it can help us, and how we can control it /	Toon, Nigel.,	We are used to thinking of computers as being a step up from calculators - very good at storing information, and maybe even at playing a logical game like chess. But up to now they haven't been able to think in ways that are intuitive, or respond to questions as a human might. All that has changed, dramatically, in the past few years. Our search engines are becoming answer engines. Artificial intelligence is already revolutionising sectors from education to healthcare to the creative arts. But how does an AI understand sentiment or context? How does it play and win games that have an almost infinite number of moves? And how can we work with AI to produce insights and innovations that are beyond human capacity, from writing code in an instant to unfolding the elaborate 3D puzzles of proteins? We stand at the brink of a historic change that will disrupt society and at the same time create enormous opportunities for those who understand how AI thinks. Nigel Toon shows how we train AI to train itself, so that it can paint images that have never existed before or converse in any language. In doing so he reveals the strange and fascinating ways that humans think, too, as we learn how to live in a world shared by machine intelligences of our own creation.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290269

290144	1	Capitalism in the platform age : | emerging assemblages of labour and welfare in urban spaces /		This open access book provides an overview of urban digital platforms such as Airbnb and Deliveroo, which, along with Amazon, Google, Facebook and other IT companies, constitute by now the infrastructures for other businesses to operate on and for our social life to go on. These platforms serve as standards-based techno-economic systems that simultaneously capture cooperation through remote coordination and organize labor via algorithm management. Based on a three-years research project, this contributed volume outlines a general theory of platform capitalism that conceives these platforms not only as technical devices, but as generative engines that operate at the interface of several aspects, such as digitalization of forms of social cooperation; algorithm-based management of labor and participation; and private and vertical appropriation of profits. These elements are somehow iconic of the capitalist evolution of the last decades, and they open up a reflection on new forms of "primitive accumulation" (in particular regarding data), on the mechanisms used to capture and extract social surplus value, and on the logistic-financial dimensions of capital. Finally, in light of the transformations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors examine how platforms can evolve into hegemonic organizational structures. Assuming we are all already living in the age of the platform, this book takes a multifaceted approach -- combining sociology with urban studies, and political sciences with economics -- to grasp the challenges our societies face in terms of ensuring fair economic growth, adequate social protections, and labor rights. It will appeal to anyone interested in digital platforms and how they are changing the organization of labor, urban spaces, and forms of governance							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290144
290142	1	Sustainability objectives in competition and intellectual property law /		This open access volume of LIDC contributions focuses on how competition and intellectual property laws incorporate sustainability objectives. Businesses are increasingly embracing sustainability objectives, driven by the international community. Although competition and intellectual property law are certainly not the only tools for addressing sustainability issues, they can play a role in moving toward a more sustainable society. Sustainability has gained prominence in competition law in all jurisdictions covered in this volume. The contributions focus on classic questions such as whether sustainability agreements restrict competition and, if so, to what extent businesses can be exempted on efficiency grounds. The papers also raise a number of questions, in particular concerning the treatment of non-market efficiencies. The soft law and case law produced by competition authorities are examined, and the leadership role of some competition authorities in the field - from advocacy to policy papers and sustainability guidelines - is highlighted. The authors call for more individual guidance to provide enhanced transparency and clarity to industry, advisors and society at large on sustainability issues, with guidelines or sustainability-related block exemptions providing even greater legal certainty. With regard to intellectual property, the contributions examine various important issues, such as the need for intellectual property rights to remain technology-neutral, ways to promote the use of sustainable technologies and incentives for licensing, and ways to promote the dissemination of sustainable technologies, including compulsory licensing, cross-licensing, open source or FRAND licensing, and replacing the destruction of counterfeit goods with recycling. The papers also discuss greenwashing and how it can be addressed through revisions to trademarks and related rights							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=290142
289933	1	Sustainability of southern African ecosystems under global change : | science for management and policy interventions /		This open access book about the sustainability of marine and terrestrial ecosystems in southern Africa provides a synthesis of the research program Science Partnerships for the Adaptation to Complex Earth System Processes (SPACES II, 2018-2022). It addresses the scientific, social, and economic issues related to climate change, its potential impacts on the various ecosystems, adaptations, and management interventions for enhancing systems resilience in Southern Africa. It is written by numerous scientists from African states and Germany and summarizes the latest research findings, which are of great relevance for a better understanding of climate change impacts, adaptations, and vulnerabilities as well as for developing management options and policy options to reduce the associated risks. This is crucial considering that the projected African population increase is exceptional. Furthermore, climate change is assumed to hit southern Africa extremely hard with a significant increase in extreme events and the frequency of severe droughts, heat waves, and flooding. Southern Africa hosts a high variety of ecosystems, which belongs to important biodiversity hotspots for unique flora and fauna. The surrounding oceans form, in turn, a bottle neck within the ocean's global thermohaline circulation, act as a still poorly understood carbon sink and source and play an important role for fisheries as they are highly productive. Considering these important aspects, the book is an important interdisciplinary contribution to the scientific literature and will find a wide readership. The book is aimed at students, teachers, and scientists in the fields of terrestrial and marine ecology, environmental, nature and landscape planning, agriculture, environmental and resource management, biodiversity, and nature conservation, as well as scientists and representatives in specialised authorities and associations, nature conservationists, and policy makers of related disciplines							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289933

289928	1	Ocean Governance (Beyond) Borders /		This Open Access book "Ocean Governance (Beyond) Borders" is concerned with the persistence of bordering in ocean space, and the possibilities that might arise if we think beyond borders for modes of oceanic management, engaging the ocean's fluid physicality and the mobile human and more-than-human life entangled with it. At a moment where ocean governance is a pressing topic amongst academics, policy makers, governments and non- governmental agencies alike, this book takes on one of the most overlooked but central devices underscoring many modes of oceanic management: the border. Uniquely combining contemporary border scholarship with cutting edge ocean governance research this book tackles themes ranging from biodiversity conservation and asylum regulations to shipping management measures, tourism, and the growing blue economy. This edited volume hence explores varied bordering practices, whilst also addressing the 'common-senseness' with which bordering is deployed at sea, questioning - and problematising - its function and efficacy. Throughout 12 carefully curated chapters, authors ask: What borders are present in the seas and oceans, where and why? In doing this the book offers readers a simple provocation: Do we need borders? And can we govern differently?							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289928
289927	1	Global Trends in Job Polarisation and Upgrading : | A Comparison of Developed and Developing Economies /		This open-access book offers a comparative analysis of changes in employment structures on a global scale, focusing on employment trends during the first decades of the 21st century across 17 developed and developing economies, including countries from Europe, North America, Central and Latin America, and Asia. The authors examine patterns of occupational change in all cases, with job upgrading and polarization being the most prevalent, and explore the factors driving these changes, such as technological change, the increased participation of women, the growth of service-oriented sectors, and others. Particular attention is given to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employment. By applying consistent methods across all countries, the book provides a comprehensive understanding of employment dynamics and trends worldwide, representing one of the most significant efforts to produce comparative evidence on a global scale to date. As such, it will be of interest to researchers and policymakers focused on labor, inequality, and economic development.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289927
289926	1	Metamodeling for Extended Reality /	Muff, Fabian,	This open access book which is based on the author's dissertation in 2024 explores the challenges of metamodeling in the context of extended reality and emphasizes the need for new concepts in metamodeling to effectively combine it with extended reality technologies. The central question of this work is how metamodeling can be used "in" and "for" extended reality. The book is structured in nine chapters: Chapter 1 introduces the topic by providing background information and outlining the research objectives, questions, methodology and structure. Chapter 2 delves into the existing literature and developments in the field. It covers various aspects of modeling, such as conceptual, enterprise, and metamodeling, as well as extended reality (XR), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and the metaverse. Next, chapter 3 presents the generic requirements for metamodeling for augmented and virtual reality by systematically deriving use cases for joining AR and metamodeling. Chapter 4 then identifies specific requirements for integrating metamodeling with XR, such as coordinate mappings, visualization of model components, detection and tracking, context, or interaction. Subsequently, chapter 5 introduces a new domain-specific visual modeling language for creating augmented reality scenarios, particularly within the context of metamodeling, before chapter 6 outlines the conceptualization and design of a 3D enhanced metamodeling platform considering extended reality, detailing its structure, components, and the interconnection of its elements. Chapter 7 then presents the initial implementation of the various components of this modeling platform, and chapter 8 evaluates the newly introduced platform both theoretically and empirically. Eventually, chapter 9 concludes the book by an alignment with the initial research questions, discussing limitations, and provides a final summary and an outlook for further research. This book mainly aims at researchers in conceptual modeling, especially in projects related to XR, VR, or AR, as the presented new domain-specific modeling method for creating workflows for XR/VR/AR applications does not assume specific prior programming knowledge.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289926
289925	1	The International Politics of Migration : | Interstate Relations and the Peoples Who Cross Borders /	Tadokoro, Masayuki,	This open access book discusses the impact of cross-border migration on the relationships between sovereign states. While there is already a vast amount of literature on immigration, it often focuses on issues such as human rights, citizenship, and social integration, reflecting the contemporary interests of Western countries. However, as long as the most fundamental norm of international politics remains the mutual recognition of exclusive jurisdictional rights over territory by sovereign states, people crossing borders pose various challenges to this system of sovereign states. It is this awareness of the issue that makes this book unique. This book examines the implications of the movement of people across national borders both for the state and for international politics. From the standpoint of international politics, the focus of the examination is the international political meaning of the transnational phenomenon of the movement of people. This is an interest that extends from the study of international political economy, which questions the significance for international politics of the transnational phenomena of international trade and international finance.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289925

289922	1	Sustainable Earnings in a Resilient Economic System : | The Power of Groupthink in Channelling Finance Towards Sustainable Goals /	Charles, Aurelie,	In a world where global finance must align with the green transition, this Open Access book challenges established economic thinking. It argues for a shift from individualism to group-focused economic theory and policy, revealing that historical financial accumulation stemmed from collective rather than individual actions. To combat detrimental herd behavior, the book advocates for methodological groupism in economic policies. This shift promises more resilient financial flows, ensuring widespread societal benefits and mitigating harm to the global ecosystem. Through data analysis of capital and labor earnings in the US, UK, France, and Italy, and the introduction of "sustainable earnings trends," the book provides actionable insights applicable from local to international levels, using the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guiding framework. This makes the book a must-read for scholars, researchers, and students of environmental economics, sustainability, labor economics, finance, public policy, and governance, as well as policymakers seeking profound insights into the future of sustainable economics and finance.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289922
289921	1	EU and Russian Hegemony in the 'Shared Neighbourhood' : | Between Coercion, Prescription, and Co-Optation /	Burmester, Isabell,	This open access book examines the EU's and Russia's policies in Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus through the prism of hegemony, a concept that it applies to both regional actors. The study cross fertilises the literatures on the EU neighbourhood policy, Russia's foreign policy, and the scholarship on power in international relations to arrive at an innovative conceptualisation of the mechanisms of hegemonic power. The comparative lens of the analysis leads to novel findings that advance our understanding of the EU's and Russia's behaviour in the EU's Eastern neighbourhood.  In this book, the existing, separate theorisations are subsumed under more generic terms and concepts, thereby rendering EU and Russian modes of influence comparable for empirical analysis. The comprehensive conceptual framework of hegemonic power in shared neighbourhoods is based on three ideal typical mechanisms of hegemonic influence: coercion, prescription, and co-optation. To understand the nature of EU and Russian hegemony in the region, the uses of the three mechanisms by Russia and the EU towards two neighbourhood countries are compared. The focus is laid on EU and Russian actions towards Moldova and Armenia since the beginning of the 2000s and the local perceptions of these actions. Thus, the comparative case study provides insights into the longer developments in this regional order that led to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The book is intended for scholars and students interested in understanding the broader context of Russia's war in Ukraine. Because of its contribution to the debate on regional powers in shared neighbourhoods, it is particularly useful for researchers analysing the (changing) power dynamics and hegemonic behaviour in this regional order. Furthermore, it offers other scholars an analytical framework to work with when analysing the policies of different regional powers.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289921
289920	1	Participatory Artificial Intelligence in Public Social Services : | From Bias to Fairness in Assessing Beneficiaries /		This open access edited volume focuses on fairness issues concerning the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for social service provision in national welfare systems. With this, it touches upon important questions in the innovation agenda of countries across continents about the ethics, justice, quality, responsibility, accountability, and transparency to use AI for state functions. The volume shows that in many countries, AI, or at least data analytics methods, are already in place to support the assessment of beneficiaries for deciding on the value criteria to distinguish between legal /fraudulent, deserving/non-deserving, or needy/non-needy recipients. The book provides a cross-cultural comparison of AI-based social assessment among national welfare systems of 9 countries across 4 continents: Spain, Estonia, Germany, Iran, India, Nigeria, Ukraine, China and USA. Based on participatory research results from multi-stakeholder inputs, especially those from vulnerable groups, the chapters in this volume show that value criteria for fairness and social justice are context-bound and vary across the globe. Furthermore, they are in constant flux, aligned to social change. Thus, the volume looks at pathways to developing culture-sensitive, responsive and participatory AI for social assessment in public service provision. The contributions are interdisciplinary and introduce perspectives from the fields of sociology, computational social science, computer science and public policy. This topical volume is of interest to a wide readership.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289920

289918	1	Bridging Borders : | Central Asian Cross-Border Cooperation in a Comparative Global Perspective /	Golunov, Sergei,	The open access book analyzes cross-border cooperation (CBC) in Central Asia from a comparative perspective. It provides new insights into four main areas: (1) It highlights international experiences in CBC to identify best practices for Central Asian states; (2) it discusses various policies of Central Asian states towards CBC, specifically those policies that impact Central Asian CBC either positively or negatively; (3) it identifies best practices and actors for successful CBC in Central Asia, including the role of non-governmental entities; (4) it provides recommendations for enhancing Central Asian CBC, drawing upon both international experiences and a thorough analysis of Central Asian contexts. The authors proceed from the assumption that effective cross-border cooperation is one of the essential conditions for successful regional integration, as it acts as a connective seam between participating states. Unfortunately, at present, no Central Asian country excels in CBC; in every case, CBC is impeded by highly centralized political systems, and lack of funding. To enhance CBC in Central Asia, it is crucial to examine the relevant experiences of other countries and regions, incorporating lessons from both successful and unsuccessful endeavors.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289918
289917	1	Migration, Transnational Flows, and the Contested Meanings of Race in Asia /	Lan, Shanshan,	This open access edited volume addresses the multi-layered relations between migration, transnational flows, and the contested meanings of race in Asia. It tries to answer the following questions: how do migration and transnational flows from the Western world impact racial knowledge formation in Asian societies? To what extent do they challenge, perpetuate, and reshape unequal power relations based on the intersection of race, gender, class, nationality, citizenship, and migration status in Asia? How are dominant Western racial categories such as race, whiteness, and blackness redefined and reconstructed in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, when transnational mobility became both heavily restricted and stigmatized ? The book is divided into three parts: Race, Language and Migration status, Covid-19 and the Dynamics of Racialization, Gender and Interracial Encounters. This book positions itself in the nexus of race, migration and pandemic research and will make a significant contribution to critical race studies, whiteness studies, globalization, multiculturalism, and social transformation in Asia. This book is aimed at students and scholars in race and migration studies in Asia and beyond. This is an open access book.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289917

289914	1	Cosmopolitan Imaginaries and International Disorder /	McKeil, Aaron C.,	While the idea of a cosmopolitan order embracing all humankind is ancient, after the Cold War it was widely believed to be an emerging future. As global interdependence and interaction through new technologies increased, literature of cosmopolitan globalization argued that these changes were setting the stage for a structural transformation of world politics. Yet, a revolt against globalism and increasingly divisive and unstable international order has dramatically contradicted this idea. This presents a puzzle for International Relations theory: Why have attempts to construct cosmopolitan order struggled to emerge in the modern global world? Cosmopolitan Imaginaries and International Disorder argues that advocacy for cosmopolitan order reform in the modern world has struggled to recognize the political identities of states and populations and to legitimize its proposed political hierarchies. As a result, these efforts have been overwhelmed by states shoring up their power and remobilizing exclusionary nationalist identities, especially when struggles are intensified in contexts of international instability and economic turmoil. In developing a theory to explain these patterns of cosmopolitan politics, this book offers insight into the limits and role of cosmopolitanism in a dividing international order after liberal globalism.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289914
289913	1	No Peer Rivals : | American Grand Strategy in the Era of Great Power Competition /	Popescu, Ionut C.,	With military maneuvers in Taiwan and the South China Sea and the eruption of war in Ukraine, the past few years have brought deteriorating diplomatic relations and increasing military and economic tensions between the United States, China, and Russia. After benefiting from the geopolitical and financial advantages conferred by a privileged status as a global superpower for three decades, the United States needs to adapt to a geopolitical shift toward competition and confrontation in order to contain China's quest for global superpower status. No Peer Rivals takes a major staple of International Relations scholarship--the offensive realist paradigm--and develops a comprehensive and practical grand strategy for the United States in this new era of Great Power Competition. The No Peer Rival framework is grounded in a realistic assessment of the most likely courses of action adopted by China, Russia, and other important regional powers. It prioritizes great power rivalry over other strategic goals, and identifies China as the biggest threat to America's unique position in the international system. This grand strategic approach carefully aligns the domestic sources of national power (economic strength, energy security, and technological prowess) to America's foreign policy and national security objectives. In addition to recommending necessary changes to America's military and diplomatic strategies, No Peer Rivals also demonstrates that a realistic approach to industrial policy, international trade, energy production, and technological superiority offers the best chance for developing the sinews of power needed to outcompete Beijing in the long run.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289913
289912	1	The International Politics of Communication : | Representing Community in a Globalizing World /	Chong, Alan,	"In an era of globalization, international communication constantly takes place across borders, defying sovereign control as it influences opinion. While diplomacy between states is the visible face of international relations, this "informal diplomacy" is usually less visible but no less powerful. Information politics can be found in propaganda, Internet politics, educational exchanges, tourism, and even popular film. The International Politics of Communication examines this informational dimension of international politics, investigating how information is generated, conveyed through channels, and directed specifically at audiences. While citizens are often portrayed as faithfully loyal supporters and beneficiaries of the modern nation-state-a fiction supported by passports, identification papers, and other notarized credentials-they are subject to the pulls of loyalty from transnational tribal affiliations, mythological and historical narratives of ethnicity, as well as the transcendental claims of religion and philosophy. Increasingly, social media also enchants non-state individuals, providing new virtual communities as the center of loyalties rather than national affiliations. By reinterpreting taken-for-granted concepts in journalism, media, political economy, nationalism, development, and propaganda as information politics, this book prepares serious-minded scholars, citizens, politicians, and social activists everywhere to understand the power plays in international communication and use alternatives to begin transforming power relations."							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289912

289910	1	Troubled People, Troubled World : | Psychotherapy, Ethics and Society /	Briant, Michael,	Ethical issues are the stuff of psychotherapy, and in fact Freud envisaged the process as one in which an unexamined, irrational and oppressive conscience gives way to one more benignly rooted in reason. Therapists endeavour to be non-judgemental and, indeed, are no more qualified to pass judgement on others than anyone else; do they nevertheless learn anything about ethics from their disciplined listening? The same question was asked after the war about the persecution of the Jews and other minorities, and it's a very live issue again, faced as we are by movements like ISIS, or Putinism in Russia, that cause great suffering in the name of religious or moral regeneration - a bewildering paradox that David Astor, former editor of The Observer called 'the scourge'.Can psychotherapy throw any light on it, or contribute any ideas as to how we might contain, if not prevent, the barbarism it sanctions? Can it offer any insights into a different, more inclusive kind of ethics, and if so, can we glean any guidance from it as to how we might further it?These are the questions the author explores, drawing on psychoanalytic thinking on these issues for over a century and illustrated by his work with individuals over four decades.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289910

289883	1	Humanities for Humans : | Clear Thinking on Challenging Issues /	Kacandes, Irene.	Can the academic humanities serve the general public to address some of today's most critical challenges? This unusual volume builds on the conversation series "Humanities for Humans," curated by Irene Kacandes and funded by the De Gruyter Foundation and the New York nonprofit 1014: Space for Ideas, to answer this question in the affirmative. By asking some North America's most prominent academics to think aloud in clear language on topics such as racism, migration, inequality, sustainability, building connection and working toward repair of our communities, this book demonstrates the ultimate value of the imagination in solving seemingly intractable problems. The authors define and distinguish. They offer historical context and concrete examples from North and South America, from Europe, from indigenous cultures, from artists and ordinary folk. By also sharing their own personal trajectories, however, these authors simultaneously anchor their insights in practical terms while highlighting the tangible role of the humanities in the everyday world.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289883
289882	1	New Silk Road : | The Architecture of the Belt and Road Initiative /	Bonino, Michele.	China's Belt and Road Initiative, started in 2013, has transformed many places around the world but also China itself. In some cases, it provided crucial infrastructure, such as the General Hospital of Niger in Niamey or the National Library of El Salvador, while it also generated entire new urban areas, e.g. the Free Zone in Khorghos, Kazakhstan, with sometimes controversial effects to local communities and the environment. Based on research undertaken at the Politecnico di Torino, this publication looks at the "Belt and Road Initiative" in architectural and spatial terms. Organized in thematic categories, it entails a survey of 20 case studies and investigates the impact of these China-backed projects. All buildings are documented with maps, architectural drawings and photographs specifically created for this book.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289882

Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is increasingly recognized as an attractive alternative to national court proceedings, especially in international business relations. This open access book focuses on ADR mechanisms in one specific geographical region: the Western Balkans. This region comprises Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Serbia. Although these countries generally have legal frameworks for ADR mechanisms in place, they remain largely underutilised in practice. Promoting ADR mechanisms in the countries of the Western Balkans could make them more attractive to foreign investors, thereby fostering economic growth. Additionally, the effective implementation of ADR mechanisms could have spill-over effects on national judiciaries, thereby increasing domestic rule of law standards. This would be highly beneficial for the Western Balkan countries, most of which are still aspiring to become Member States of the European Union (EU). To achieve this, they are required to promote the use of ADR mechanisms and align their legal frameworks with EU standards.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289881

289879	1	Understanding Human-Nature Practices for Environmental Management : | Examples from Northern Europe /	Keskitalo, E. C. H.	Nature has often been understood in literature through a disjunction to human systems. This can be seen in the nature-culture binary, or even more clearly in the opposition of 'wilderness' to 'civilization'.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289879

289876	1	User Experience + Artificial Intelligence : | Assessing the Qualities of AI-Infused Systems /	Spallazzo, Davide.	This open access book addresses the thriving trend of embedding artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities in products and services reaching the lay public, focusing on the user experience (UX) they prompt from a designerly perspective. It offers a UX evaluation method designed explicitly for AI-infused systems to answer one of the core problems affecting the relationship and interactions people have with such artefacts. The work investigates how people perceive and make sense of systems integrating AI capabilities, trying to understand how their meaning and significance can affect the experience of such products and what design challenges may arise. Given the fundamental premise that current UX methods cannot address AI-infused artefacts, it introduces the results of Meet-AI, a research project exploring specific ways to tackle these problems. The book then presents a comprehensive analysis of current UX methods, and a literature review focused on detecting possible gaps and the most suitable qualities to describe AI-infused systems, and summarizes the findings from all previous investigations into a UX evaluation scale: AIXE (AI user eXperience Evaluation). The book also portrays how the tool has been validated and expanded to become a more comprehensive method. It further describes how the scale has been applied to a comparative study of domestic smart speakers, and introduces a reversed interpretation of the outcomes, framing them as heuristics to inform the early phases of the design process and paving the way for future experimentations in the meta-design dimension.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289876
289875	1	The Terrorism News Beat : | Professionalism, Profit, and the Press /	Hoffman, Aaron M.	Critics of terrorism news coverage often describe it as a sensationalized and intimidating area of reporting. However, this characterization offers a misleading guide to the coverage of terrorist threats and attacks, counterterrorism, and community responses to terrorism that appears in U.S. newspapers. Counterterrorism--not terrorist threats or attacks--is the most reported-on subject in newspapers such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Rather than focusing on accounts of terrorist attacks, militarized counterterrorism, or counterterrorism failures, journalists more often cover counterterrorism successes, criminal justice, and diplomatic or community responses to terrorism.  The Terrorism News Beat engages thinking about terrorism and the news media from the fields of political science, communication, criminology, economics, and sociology using multimethod research involving more than 2,500 newspaper articles published between 1997 and 2018. Chapters analyze the terrorism news beat's subject matter, language, and coverage of the Oklahoma City Bombing, Olympic Park bombing, 9/11 attacks, DC Sniper case, and Dallas Police shooting. When it comes to language use, Hoffman finds that, rather than giving into the temptation to convey the news in lurid detail, journalists are minimalists. The language used to depict events on the terrorism beat is typically moderate and extreme words like "torture" appear only as necessary. The Terrorism News Beat shows that contrary to claims of sensationalism, the tone of terrorism coverage becomes even more sober during terrorism crises than it is during non-crisis periods and meets journalistic standards for quality.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289875
289874	1	Gaming the Metaverse /	Beil, Benjamin.	Neal Stephensons 1992 novel Snow Crash conceived of the Metaverse as an escapist medium within a dystopian future. By the early 2000s, his vision had evolved into a blueprint for pioneering virtual worlds, notably Second Life. In the 2010s, technology companiesfrom Meta to Epic Gamesrecast the Metaverse as the next frontier of digital experience and revenue generation. Now, in the 2020s, the still speculative concept encompasses a convergence of extended reality technologies alongside blockchain systems and artificial intelligence.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289874
289873	1	Rule and resistance in the nuclear order : | the subversive struggle for a nuclear weapons ban /	Hach, Sascha.	The structures of rule in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) have been challenged by the Humanitarian Initiative and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPN). How could this rebellion of comparatively small players against the militarily most powerful states in the world succeed? The answer lies in the formation of an alliance of non-nuclear weapon states and civil society using subversive techniques to counter the discursive and procedural dominance of nuclear weapon states. This resistance was also partially motivated by anti-colonialism. With his analysis, Sascha Hach reveals patterns of exercising power in international relations, the functioning of the nuclear order, and creative methods of success in resistance.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289873

289870	1	Disability inclusion in humanitarian crises : | robust human rights norms? /	Funke, Carolin.	This open access book studies disability inclusion in humanitarian crises. It addresses the challenges of recognizing and including persons with disabilities and indicates the degree to which disability is being mainstreamed in international law and humanitarian action. Further, it explores how international organizations have promoted a rights-based understanding of disability in international law, and to what extent this understanding has gained acceptance in humanitarian policy and practice. Theoretically, Funke and Dijkzeul explore the robustness of the disability inclusion norm cluster during processes of institutionalization, translation, and implementation. The book examines these processes from a multi-level perspective, which involves a variety of actors beyond states, including organizations of persons with disabilities. Situating their analysis within the literature on humanitarian action and development, the authors argue for an increased focus on processes "below" the international level in international relations and international law scholarship to better understand disability inclusion.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289870
289869	1	Crypto crowds : | singularities and multiplicities on the blockchain /		"Ownership of cryptocurrencies and related assets has given rise to self-described "coin-communities." Discussing the notions around social dynamics, this collection explores how crowd and community formations manifest empirically in cryptocurrency sociality online. It suggests that tensions between cryptocurrency adopters generate political, moral, and cosmological realities, which intensify crowding dynamics online. Pioneering in its approach to the increasing digitalization and datafication of everyday life, the volume encourages scholars to explore further how "decentralized" and "trustless" technologies take part in the construction of postmodern crowds"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289869
289766	1	After the new social democracy /	Fitzpatrick, Tony,	This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. Social democracy has made a political comeback in recent years, especially under the influence of the 'Third Way'. Not everyone is convinced, however, that 'Third Way' social democracy is the best means of reviving the Left's project. This book considers this dissent and offers an alternative approach. Bringing together a range of social and political theories, it engages with some contemporary debates regarding the present direction and future of the Left. Drawing upon egalitarian, feminist and environmental ideas, the book proposes that the social democratic tradition can be renewed but only if the dominance of conservative ideas is challenged more effectively. It explores a number of issues with this aim in mind, including justice, the state, democracy, new technologies, future generations and the advances in genetics.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289766
289765	1	Market relations and the competitive process /		This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. There has been increasing interest and debate in recent years on the instituted nature of economic processes in general and the related ideas of the market, in particular the competitive process. This debate lies at the interface between two largely independent disciplines, economics and sociology, and reflects an attempt to bring the two fields of discourse more closely together. This book explores this interface in a number of ways, looking at the competitive process and market relations from a number of different perspectives. It includes a wide range of contributors, most of whom are leading writers and thinkers in the field.The book considers the social role of economic institutions in society and examines the various meanings embedded in the word 'markets', as well as developing arguments on the nature of competition as an instituted economic process, rather than as competition being something that disturbs norms or institutions. It goes on to consider the deeper and more involved connection between markets and cognition, explaining how institutions can ease cognitive difficulties, and the effect of culture on markets and competition is also fully studied.This book will be of vital use to students and academics working in the fields of economics, sociology and business studies. It sketches the agenda for future research about markets and the competitive process.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289765

Comparing and contrasting propaganda in Serbia and Croatia from 1986 to 1999, this book analyses each group's contemporary interpretations of history and current events. It offers a detailed discussion of Holocaust imagery and the history of victim-centred writing in nationalist theory, including the links between the comparative genocide debate, the so-called Holocaust industry, and Serbian and Croatian nationalism. There is a detailed analysis of Serbian and Croatian propaganda over the Internet, detailing how and why the Internet war was as important as the ground wars in Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, and a theme-by-theme analysis of Serbian and Croatian propaganda, using contemporary media sources, novels, academic works and journals.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289764
289763	1	The forgotten French /	Atkin, Nicholas,	This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. It is widely assumed that the French in the British Isles during the Second World War were fully fledged supporters of General de Gaulle, and that, across the channel at least, the French were a 'nation of resisters'. This study reveals that most exiles were on British soil by chance rather than by design, and that many were not sure whether to stay. Overlooked by historians, who have concentrated on the 'Free French' of de Gaulle, these were the 'Forgotten French': refugees swept off the beaches of Dunkirk; servicemen held in camps after the Franco-German armistice; Vichy consular officials left to cater for their compatriots; and a sizeable colonist community based mainly in London. Drawing on little-known archival sources, this study examines the hopes and fears of those communities who were bitterly divided among themselves, some being attracted to Pétain as much as to de Gaulle.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289763
289762	1	George III : | King and politicians 1760-1770 /	Thomas, Peter,	This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. The eighteenth-century was long deemed 'the classical age of the constitution' in Britain, with cabinet government based on a two-party system of Whigs and Tories in Parliament, and a monarchy whose powers had been emasculated by the Glorious Revolution o. This study furthers the work of Sir Lewis Namier who argued in 1929 that no such party system existed, George III was not a cypher and that Parliament was an administration comprising of factions and opposition. George III was a high-profile and well-known character in British history whose policies have often been blamed for the loss of Britain's American colonies, around whom rages a perennial dispute over his aims: was he seeking to restore royal power, or merely excercising his constitutional rights?. The first chronological survey of the first ten years of George III's reign through power politics and policy-making.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289762
289761	1	Human Rights and the Borders of Suffering : | The Promotion of Human Rights in International Politics /	Brown, Anne,	This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. This study of human rights argues for a greater openness in the ways we approach human rights and international rights promotion. Starting with the realities of abuse rather than the liberal architectures of rights, it casts human rights as a language for probing the political dimensions of suffering, and shows Western rights models as substantial but problematic. Brown shows that rather than a message from "us" to "them", rights promotion is a long and difficult conversation about the relationship between political organisation and suffering. Three case studies are explored - the Tiananmen Square massacre, East Timor and the circumstances of indigenous Australians.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289761

This systematic study considers how international environmental agreements are transformed into political action in Russia, using three illuminating case studies on the implementation process in the fields of fisheries management, nuclear safety and air pollution control. It develops the social science debate on international environmental regimes and "implementing activities" at both national and international level to include regional considerations.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289760
289759	1	The Israeli response to Jewish extremism and violence /	Pedahzur, Ami,	This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. This book looks at the theoretical issue of how a democracy can defend itself from those wishing to subvert or destroy it without being required to take measures that would impinge upon the basic principles of the democratic idea. It links social and institutional perspectives to the study, and includes a case study of the Israeli response to Jewish extremism and violence, which tests the theoretical framework outlined in the first chapter. There is an extensive diachronic scrutiny of the state's response to extremist political parties, violent organizations and the infrastructure of extremism and intolerance within Israeli society. The book emphasises the dynamics of the response and the factors that encourage or discourage the shift from less democratic and more democratic models of response.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289759
289758	1	Turkey: facing a new millennium : | Coping with intertwined conflicts /	Nachmani, Amikam,	This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. Turkey's involvement in the Gulf War in 1991 paved the way for the country's acceptance into the European Union. This book traces that process and in the first part looks at Turkey's foreign policy in the 1990s, considering the ability of the country to withstand the repercussions of the fall of communism. It focuses on Turkey's achievement in halting and minimising the effects of the temporary devaluation in its strategic importance that resulted from the waning of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the skilful way in which Turkey avoided becoming embroiled in the ethnic upheavals in Central Asia, the Balkans and the Middle East, and the development of a continued policy of closer integration into the European and western worlds.Internal politics are the focus of the second part of the book, addressing the curbing of the Kurdish revolt, the economic gains made, and the strengthening of civil society. Nachmani goes on to analyse the prospects for Turkey in the twenty-first century, in the light of the possible integration into Europe, which may leave the country's leadership free to deal effectively with domestic issues.This book will make crucial reading for anyone studying Turkish politics, or indeed European or European Union politics.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289758
289757	1	The Conservatives in crisis /		This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. The Conservative Party's survival as a significant political force was now open to serious question for the first time since the crisis over the Corn Laws. The Labour Party has commanded a fairly consistent level of attention, whether in office or in opposition. But it seems that the Conservatives are fated to be regarded either as unavoidable or irrelevant. This book presents an analysis that suggests that the party leader plays a less important role in Conservative recoveries than a distinctive policy programme and an effective party organization. It examines the Conservative position on a series of key issues, highlighting the difficult dilemmas which confronted the party after 1997, notably on economic policy. New Labour's acceptance of much of the main thrust of Thatcherite economic policy threw the Conservatives off balance. The pragmatism of this new position and the 'In Europe, not run by Europe' platform masked a significant move towards Euro-skepticism. The book also traces how the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Parties adapted to the creation of the Scottish Parliament, exploring the re-organisation of the Scottish party, its electoral fortunes and political prospects in the new Scottish politics. It examines issues of identity and nationhood in Conservative politics in the 1997-2001 period, focusing on the 'English Question' and the politics of 'race'. The predictable results of the Conservatives' failure to develop an attractive, consistent narrative are then analysed. Right-wing populist parties with charismatic leaders enjoyed some electoral success under the proportional representation systems in 2002.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289757
289756	1	The United States Congress /	English, Ross,	This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. The role of the Congress is essential to any study of American government and politics. It would be impossible to gain a complete understanding of the American system of government without an appreciation of the nature and workings of this essential body. This text looks at the workings of the United States Congress, and uses the Republican period of ascendancy, which lasted from 1994 until 2000, as an example of how the Congress works in practice. The book illustrates the basic principles of Congress using contemporary and recent examples, while also drawing attention to the changes that took place in the 1990s. The period of Republican control is absent from many of the standard texts and is of considerable academic interest for a number of reasons, not least the 1994 election, the budget deadlock in 1995 and the Clinton impeachment scandal of 1999. The book traces the origin and development of the United States Congress, before looking in depth at the role of representatives and senators, the committee system, parties in Congress, and the relationship between Congress and the President, the media and interest groups.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289756
289755	1	EU development cooperation : | From model to symbol /		This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. It is increasingly recognised that EU development cooperation policy has failed to meet its stated aims. In this book, Arts and Dickson ask the obvious and important question: if the policy doesn't work, why bother with it?The authors assess why EU development policy has become largely ineffective, citing among the external causal factors the liberalisation of trade, and the growing influence of US and international actors such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund upon EU policy. It also considers contributing factors within the EU such as the enlargement of its membership and the resulting shifts in priorities.It is this analysis of internal and external factors affecting the decline of EU development policy that makes this study both innovative and unique. It brings together an impressive range of contributors from different disciplines resulting in a thorough and intelligent assessment of the debate.This study will appeal to advanced level undergraduates and academics of European politics in general, EU integration, development studies, and International Relations.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289755
289754	1	Mapping European security after Kosovo /		This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. In the story of post-Cold War conceptual confusion, the war in and over Kosovo stands out as a particularly interesting episode. This book provides new and stimulating perspectives on how Kosovo has shaped the new Europe. It breaks down traditional assumptions in the field of security studies by sidelining the theoretical worldview that underlies mainstream strategic thinking on recent events in Kosovo. The book offers a conceptual overview of the Kosovo debate, placing these events in the context of globalisation, European integration and the discourse of modernity and its aftermath. It then examines Kosovo's impact on the idea of war. One of the great paradoxes of the war in Kosovo was that it was not just one campaign but two: there was the ethnic cleansing campaign in Kosovo and the allied bombing campaign against targets in Kosovo and all over Serbia. Serbia's killing of Kosovo has set the parameters of the Balkanisation-integration nexus, offering 'Europe' (and the West in general) a unique opportunity to suggest itself as the strong centre that keeps the margins from running away. Next, it investigates 'Kosovo' as a product of the decay of modern institutions and discourses like sovereignty, statehood, the warring state or the United Nations system. 'Kosovo' has introduced new overtones into the European Weltanschauung and the ways in which 'Europe' asserts itself as an independent power discourse in a globalising world: increasingly diffident, looking for firm foundations in the conceptual void of the turn of the century.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289754

Ireland appears to be in the process of a remarkable social change, a process which has dramatically reversed a hitherto seemingly unstoppable economic decline. This exciting new book systematically scrutinises the interpretations and prescriptions that inform the 'Celtic Tiger'. Takes the standpoint that a more critical approach to the course of development being followed by the Republic is urgently required. Sets out to expose the fallacies that drive the fashionable rhetoric of Tigerhood. An esteemed list of contributors deal with issues such as immigration, the role of women, globalisation, and changing economic and social conditions.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289753

This book provides a complete overview of the of parties in France. The social and ideological profiles of all the major parties are analysed chapter by chapter, highlighting their principal functions and dynamics within the system. These are complemented by analyses of bloc and system features, including the pluralist left, Europe, and the ideological space in which the parties operate. In particular, the book addresses the impressive capacity of French parties and their leaders to adapt themselves to the changing concerns of their electorates and to a shifting institutional context.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289752
289751	1	Rethinking European Union foreign policy /		This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. This book reviews a variety of approaches to the study of the European Union's foreign policy. Much analysis of EU foreign policy contains theoretical assumptions about the nature of the EU and its member states, their inter-relationships, the international system in which they operate and the nature of European integration. Such assumptions, when not discussed openly, often curtail debate. This book opens up this field of enquiry so students, observers and analysts of EU foreign policy can review a range of tools and theoretical templates from which the development and the trajectory of the EU's foreign policy can be studied.Situated at the interface between European studies and international relations, the book outlines how the EU relates to the rest of the world, explaining its effort towards creating a credible, effective and principled foreign, security and defence policy.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289751
289750	1	The Kosovo crisis and the evolution of a post-Cold War European security /		This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. Analyses the international response to the crisis in Kosovo, and its broader implications by examining its diplomatic, military and humanitarian features. Unravelling these implications can be challenging as it remains an event replete with paradoxes - the originality of this book's approach lies in its exploration of these paradoxes. The crisis in Kosovo has been a headline grabbing event - a serious study of the implications of the conflict on wider European security issues and institutions is urgently required.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289750

289603	1	The South China Sea : | the Geo-Political Epicenter of the Indo-Pacific? /		This open access book focuses on the geopolitical competition in the South China Sea, an area with highly concentrated choke points in the Indo-Pacific, presenting ideas and recommendations to manage this competition and foster cooperation to maintain a peaceful and stable environment and promote sustainable governance of the South China Sea and of the Indo-Pacific in a broader sense. The increasingly complex geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific has made the South China Sea the epicenter of strategic competition between the great powers, with a rising China on the one hand and the United States, its allies, and partners on the other. In this strategic chessboard, the South China Sea is a test of resilience of the rules-based international order, such as versus grey zone operations, as well as disruptive technological developments in both traditional and non-traditional domains. The book incorporates foreign policy analysis methods to analyze and forecast key players' goals, intentions, and behaviors within the competitive strategic environment of the South China Sea. The success or failure of managing major power competition in the South China Sea, one of the hot spots of the Indo-Pacific region, will determine the future structure of international relations. In addition, as a dynamically developing region of the world, promoting collaborative ideas, particularly in areas related to conflict management is essential for maintaining a peaceful and stable environment, restoring economic growth, and progressing toward a sustainable future. This book is of interest to politicians, policy-makers, experts, scholars, researchers, and other readers who are interested in how regional issues can shape the global order.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289603
289602	1	The Nexus Between Legal Pluralism and Inclusive Finance : | Insights from Ethiopia and South Africa /	Yimer, Gebreyesus,	This open access book provides detailed information on informal credit markets in Africa and how various legal systems affect these markets. Laws that impose strict formalism exclude many people from the financial system. The lessons learned from the informal credit markets in Ethiopia and South Africa indicate that pluralism offers better opportunities for people to access affordable and sustainable financial services. Inclusive legal systems promote inclusive financial systems. Therefore, international development organisations, financial institutions, international financial policymakers and standard setters should embrace pluralism to foster sustainable, inclusive and equitable financial systems. Pluralism recognises local innovation and creativity, which are vital for inclusive financial systems to flourish. In developing countries, many people who have no or only limited access to the services of official financial institutions often depend on informal credit markets. National law is the most critical element in terms of determining the operations of informal credit markets, defining the boundaries between formal and informal markets, and shaping the consequences of involvement in informal credit markets. This book will interest researchers, scholars, and students in the fields of legal theory, law and society, law and anthropology, legal pluralism, law and culture, and African law.

The contributors to this volume examine how memory is mobilised and how cultural, collective, and individual memories are being reshaped to deal with the ruptures and threats posed by the war. They offer a multi-scalar perspective on the transformational effects of war and displacement on Ukrainian society in various contexts local, regional, national, and global and deal with shifts of memory and symbolic representations, experiences of dislocation, shifts in the linguistic and religious landscapes, gender roles, and repercussions of war on minority groups.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289598
289597	1	Islamists and the Global Order : | Between Resistance and Recognition /	Pfeifer, Hanna,	Studies the ways in which Islamists engage with, rather than fight, the Western-dominated global order. ¦ This book presents a thought-provoking challenge to the commonly held belief that Islamists uniformly reject the Western-dominated world order. In the wake of George W. Bush's declaration of a "global war on terror" in 2001, Islamists have often been associated with violence, opposition to liberal values, and the disruption of order. However, a closer examination reveals that only a fraction of the groups categorised as "Islamist" genuinely combat the global order. Through an in-depth analysis of the discourses of Tunisian Ennahda and Lebanese Hezbollah, this book demonstrates that Islamist stances toward the world order involve a delicate balance between resistance to certain aspects of the Western-dominated order and recognition of others.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289597
289596	1	Sports and Human Rights /	Boillet, V eronique,	"Based on a series of themes and case studies, this book aims to illustrate the impact of sports policies and practices on individuals and their identities, and to analyze the potential solutions offered by international human rights law (IHRL) for these infringements. As the governance and regulation of sport are seen as illustrations of other forms of normativity, this book also contributes to the conversation about the transnational dimension of law and legal orders. In this respect, it illustrates that normative autonomy in the field of sport, associated with the idea of lex sportiva, tends to be relative regarding IHRL. The sporting environment is not disconnected from major contemporary social issues: it constitutes a public space in which injustices can be denounced, but also the theater in which prejudices are perpetuated against various parties, such as athletes or workers. IHRL commonly addresses attacks on individual dignity and social justice issues by guaranteeing rights to individuals and offering them protection mechanisms. In this context, can IHRL solve the problems encountered in the sporting environment? This is the question that animates this volume"							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289596

289589	1	Educational Commons : | Democratic Values, Social Justice and Inclusion in Education /		This open access book presents the final findings from the case studies developed within the Horizon 2020 SMOOTH project Educational Spaces. Passing through Enclosures and Reversing Inequalities through Educational Commons. The overall objective of the project was to understand, develop, and accelerate the potential impact of education on reversing inequalities for active social inclusion of children and young people at risk in Europe, through introducing the emergent paradigm of the “commons” as an alternative value and action system in the field of education (preschools, schools, and after-school programs). SMOOTH critically draws out the implications of the commons for refiguring education and for social change in general, on a footing of equality, sharing, participation, togetherness, caring, and freedom. Universities, research laboratories, municipalities, NGOs, museums, and youth organizations, in different European countries, have worked together to achieve the above aim involving almost 200 educators and teachers, and 800 children, and providing interesting insights and suggestions on how to implement educational commons in many different educational contexts. The target audience comprises policymakers and education leaders, students from Education and Communication degrees, researchers, and educators from both formal and non-formal educational contexts.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289589
289588	1	Decentralization, Local Governance, and Inequality in the Middle East and North Africa /		While many scholars, policymakers, and development practitioners view decentralization as a way to increase participation, strengthen political representation, and improve social welfare, little is known about the experiences of communities in the context of decentralization - particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. This volume directs our attention toward the ways in which decentralization is "lived locally" by citizens of the MENA region, underscoring the simultaneous influences of individual-level factors (e.g., gender, education) and local context (e.g., development levels, electoral institutions) on governance processes and outcomes. A group of international scholars brings together methodologically diverse, original research in Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, and Tunisia to expand the literature on decentralization. Following a preface by Hicham Alaoui, the empirical chapters are arranged into three thematic sections. These focus on subnational variations in the relationships between central and local actors, citizen engagement with state and non-state institutions, and the extent to which representatives reflect their local communities. Together, these chapters provide important insights into governance, participation, and representation in the MENA and open new questions for furthering the study of governance and local development. Only by unpacking perspectives and governance experiences at the micro-level can we understand how decentralization policies affect citizens' everyday lives.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289588

In the real world, the worst effects of climate change are likely to be felt by developing countries, while most of the decisions will be made by rich, industrialized countries. And while the world as a whole would be better off if all nations reduced their greenhouse gas emissions, any given nation could decide it would be even better off if it continued emitting and let other nations take care of the problem. These disaster experiments test how real people respond to climate change's unique constellation of challenges and deliver a positive message: People will prevent disaster.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289584

289535	1	The formation of Japan-ROK security relations : | meeting the evolving Cold War challenge /	Choi, Kyungwon.	This open access book argues that Japan-ROK security relations were formed in the process of adjusting the threat perception gap and policy conflict between the two countries. Conventional analyses using a "cooperation or conflict" dichotomy are too limited to capture the complex coordination of interests that security relations entail. In comparison, this book focuses on how, as they interacted on security concerns, Japan and the ROK had different threat perceptions and foreign policy orientations that resulted in friction over the means and methods of responses and shines a light on the changes apparent in the adjustment process. The author aims to elucidate how Japan and the ROK approached security cooperation over the period from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s. As Japan and the ROK looked to reconcile the differing political positions involved in these security and détente requirements, they explored and began to show new developments in bilateral security cooperation. This book provides a new perspective on Japan-ROK security relations and through this lens a broader view of international relations in East Asia. It also proves useful in understanding bilateral cooperation in the security field following the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289535

289530	1	Data protection and information privacy : | perceptions across cultures /	Thir, Veronika.	The impact of cultural factors on perceptions of and attitudes toward privacy is often neglected in privacy studies. Yet, understanding these factors is crucial in our globalized world, where businesses, governments and researchers rely on data from different cultures. This book makes a contribution to closing this gap. It presents and discusses findings from a large, comparative cross-cultural study on professionals' views of key data protection and information privacy issues, such as data autonomy, the data power of companies and governments, and the impact of data protection and information privacy regulations on companies, consumers, and the state. The book facilitates a better understanding of attitudes toward data protection and privacy across cultures by highlighting areas in which professionals around the world are (dis-)satisfied with data protection regulations and practices, and showing how culture-specific factors can help to explain differences in this area.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289530

289528	1	Service innovation and management : | digitalization, service infusion and customer experience /	Witell, Lars.	This open access book investigates how digitalization and service infusion are changing service provision and the customer experience. It highlights the central role of service management and service innovation in making these changes not only appear in theory but also implementing them in business practice. At the beginning of the 21st century, many manufacturing firms struggled to exploit the financial potential of service businesses, a phenomenon described as the service paradox. While many manufacturing firms are still struggling with this paradox, several firms (both service and manufacturing firms) are simultaneously struggling with digitalization. This phenomenon can be viewed as the digitalization paradox, i.e., as a situation in which companies invest in digitalization but struggle to reach the expected revenue growth. By applying the lens of service innovation to digitalization and service infusion, the book showcases how firms can overcome the service and digitalization paradoxes, transform service provision, and improve the customer experience. It offers comprehensive coverage, blending literature reviews, conceptualizations, empirical illustrations, and case studies to offer a multifaceted perspective on corporate strategies, illuminating pathways to address the challenges posed by the service and digitalization paradoxes. Built on the latest research from the CTF - Service Research Center at Karlstad University, Sweden, this book offers a valuable resource for managers seeking practical strategies and approaches to enhance their understanding and implementation of service management and marketing principles. It will also appeal to academics with an interest in service management and marketing.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289528

289520	1	Business and biodiversity : | reciprocal connections in the context of socio-ecological production landscapes and seascapes (SEPLS) /	Nishi, Maiko.	This open access book presents useful knowledge and lessons that derive from on-the-ground activities and contributes to policy recommendations, focusing on the reciprocal connections between business and biodiversity in the context of social-ecological production landscapes and seascapes (SEPLS). It introduces a set of concrete examples demonstrating the relevance of SEPLS to aspects of reciprocal connections between business and biodiversity. The case studies highlight the roles, attitudes, motivations, and actions of multiple stakeholders in conserving biodiversity while providing other benefits that directly or indirectly contribute to businesses. They also illustrate on-the-ground impacts of businesses in SEPLS - including positive and negative ones, providing insights on how to categorize and measure the impacts and dependency of businesses on biodiversity and nature's contributions to people. This will help facilitate policy learning and evidence-based decision-making to promote the achievement of global goals including the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Many of the case studies concerning SEPLS management derived from the International Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative (IPSI) provide rich evidence to detail and help clarify the interdependency between businesses and biodiversity while exemplifying innovative solutions to facilitate more sustainable business decisions and actions for socially and ecologically sound outcomes. Furthermore, the experiences in managing SEPLS where multiple actors negotiate and collaborate to meet diverse needs and interests provide practical insights on the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders and how to build partnerships to promote systemic changes towards sustainable futures. The book provides key messages derived from a synthesis of the case study findings, which will help stakeholders including policymakers, scientists, and practitioners to deepen the understanding of reciprocal connections between business and biodiversity and clarify challenges and opportunities for promoting more sustainable businesses and at the same time safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems. This in turn will help further the science-policy-practice interfaces related to biodiversity, ecosystem services, and sustainable development.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289520
289519	1	The risks and ethics of human gene editing : | a philosophical guide to the arguments /	Hayenhjelm, Madeleine.	This Open Access book is about the risks and the ethics of human germline gene editing, i.e., the possibility to make heritable changes to the DNA of early human embryos or germ cells. Is there something particularly morally problematic about editing the human germline? Is there something unique about germline editing, and, if so, does this suggest that we ought not to edit the human germline, or only in particular circumstances or for particular purposes? What would be a wise and responsible approach to editing the human germline from a moral perspective? The book has three broad aims. First, to present an inclusive map over the current scholarly debate on the ethics of human germline gene editing. Second, to provide a philosophical and critical guide to the various ideas and arguments in this debate. Third, to apply an ethics of risk perspective and defend a morally cautious position on human germline gene editing.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289519
289518	1	AI, sacred violence, and war : | the case of Gaza /	Gray, Chris Hables.	This open access book is about how Israel is using Algorithmic Intelligence (AI) and other computer technology in military operations in the Gaza Strip to achieve goals based on ancient religious entitlements. Changes in Israel Defense Force (IDF) ethical codes and innovation policies have not led to victory, but have resulted in a wide range of War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in a strategy focused on The Torture of Gaza, which includes ethnic cleansing and is approaching genocide. It covers the history of using AI in war, and current U.S. and Israeli military AI technologies such as Maven, Iron Dome, Pegasus, the Alchemist, Gospel, Lavender, and Where's Daddy, all tested and perfected in the Palestinian Laboratory and marketed as such. This book also places the current data-driven and AI-directed assault on Palestine in the context of Postmodern War, which precludes military victories and enshrines the profits and power of the U.S.-Israeli military-industrial complex in a system of perpetual war and militarized technological innovation. Through an analysis of Israeli military policies, AI, sacred texts, and the basic tenets of postmodern war, the book ultimately reveals the limits of the IDF's embrace of illusions about new technologies producing actual victory. War today is about winning hearts and minds, not body counts. As fundamentalist politics achieve more and more power around the world in the context of new information technologies, there is growing danger to the future of all of us.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289518
289517	1	Assessing feasibility with value-laden models : | discussing the normativity of integrated assessment models /	Hollnaicher, Simon.	In this Open-Access-book, the author investigates the value dimension of Integrated Assessment Models and their application to questions of feasibility. Integrated models provide a quantified representation of the interaction between the socio-economic system with the climate and serve as a pivotal tool at the intersection of climate science, policymakers, and society. This book critically examines how IAMs approach the concept of feasibility. It unpacks the value assumptions embedded within integrated modeling, critiques the implicit normativity of these models, and proposes principles for responsibly managing value judgments in scientific advice. Arguing for a thick conception of feasibility--one that integrates key normative dimensions--it highlights the gap between conceptual discussions of feasibility and the scientific practices that inform feasibility assessments. Addressed to both philosophers and integrated modelers, this book sheds light on the implicit values shaping our collective visions for the future.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289517
289516	1	Brunei Darussalam's economic transition in a shifting global Asia /	Khalid, Ahmed M.	This is an Open Access book. The international political economy is confronted by a number of overlapping crises. These include the climate emergency, rapid technological advancement, the high volume of globalised trade and financial flows, cross-border labour movement, rising inequality, geopolitical tensions, and frequent economic crises and natural disasters. Many developing countries are going through a period of urgent transformation and transition to adopt new policies to cope with such challenges and achieve and maintain sustainable and inclusive socioeconomic development. This path-breaking volume explores the issues shaping the response of Brunei Darussalam, long dependent on its oil and gas sector, to these challenges. The discussions presented here are framed by the notion of 'development in transition'--a mix of well-designed policies driven by timely implementation, enforcement and monitoring, as well as international cooperation to ensure sustainable development and distribution of benefits on an equitable basis. Through fine-grained analyses of key economic sectors--including natural resources, employment patterns, financial services, global value chains, international trade, tourism and the role of the public sector--the contributors offer a critical assessment of Brunei's policy responses. This transitional policy mix is situated in relation to the overarching development strategy called Wawasan Brunei 2035 (Brunei Vision 2035), which broadly maps onto the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. Academic scholars, university students and others interested in the study of contemporary Brunei and broader questions of economic transition in Asia will find this volume an invaluable resource for a deeper understanding of how development paths and priorities are being managed to meet pressing global and local challenges.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289516

289151	1	What really went wrong : | the West and the failure of democracy in the Middle East /	Gerges, Fawaz A.,	An ambitious revisionist history of the modern Middle East What Really Went Wrong offers a fresh and incisive assessment of American foreign policy’s impact on the history and politics of the modern Middle East. Looking at flashpoints in Iranian, Egyptian, Syrian, and Lebanese history, Fawaz A. Gerges shows how postwar U.S. leaders made a devil’s pact with potentates, autocrats, and strongmen around the world. Washington sought to tame assertive nationalists and to protect repressive Middle Eastern regimes in return for compliance with American hegemonic designs and uninterrupted flows of cheap oil. The book takes a counterfactual approach, asking readers to consider how the political trajectories of these countries and, by extension, the entire region may have differed had U.S. foreign policy privileged the nationalist aspirations of patriotic and independent Middle Eastern leaders and people. Gerges argues that rather than focusing on rolling back communism, extracting oil, and pursuing interventionist and imperial policies in Iran, Egypt, and beyond, postwar U.S. leaders should have allowed the Middle East greater autonomy in charting its own political and economic development. In so doing, the contemporary Middle East may have had better prospects for stability, prosperity, peace, and democracy. --							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289151

289149	1	Oil, the state, and war : | the foreign policies of petrostates /	Ashford, Emma,	"Petrostates play an outsize role in world affairs. The largest producers of oil and natural gas are wealthy states that translate that wealth into influence. They start more wars and support violent proxies abroad. Oil-rich states prop up the global arms trade, but they also use their wealth for diplomatic and aid purposes. Many assume that petrostates can use their contribution to global oil supply as a weapon, but this is more myth than reality. Emma Ashford provides a comprehensive exploration of the foreign policy capabilities of oil-rich states through qualitative and quantitative analysis and short case studies of the foreign policies of petrostates. At the same time, the book argues that there are different types of petrostates that exhibit vastly different behaviors and capabilities. In exploring the universe of petrostates through a unique typology, this book helps us to better understand the diverse ways in which oil shapes the foreign policy of these states, and, in turn, how they shape the world"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289149

The United States is conceptually unprepared to face this potentially unstable new era of nuclear multipolarity. The lessons of negotiating arms control in the first nuclear age during the Cold War have faded from memory, and the nonproliferation and disarmament instruments that were developed under post-Cold War US hegemony in the second nuclear age are ill suited to the future. David A. Cooper proposes relearning, reviving, and adapting classic arms control theory and negotiating practices to steer the world away from dangerous and destabilizing nuclear arms races. He surveys the history of nuclear arms control efforts, revisits what we know about the dynamics of nuclear weapons from strategic theory, and interviews US defense practitioners to glean insights about both the past and the emerging era.

289146	1	Breaking the mold : | India's untraveled path to prosperity /	Rajan, Raghuram G.,	The new path for economic development that India must create The whole world has a stake in India's future, and that future hinges on whether India can develop its economy and deliver for its population--now the world's largest--while staying democratic. India's economy has overtaken the United Kingdom's to become the fifth-largest in the world, but it is still only one-fifth the size of China's, and India's economic growth is too slow to provide jobs for millions of its ambitious youth. Blocking India's current path are intense global competition in low-skilled manufacturing, increasing protectionism and automation, and the country's majoritarian streak in politics. In Breaking the Mold, Raghuram Rajan and Rohit Lamba show why and how India needs to blaze a new path if it's to succeed. India diverged long ago from the standard development model, the one followed by China--from agriculture to low-skilled manufacturing, then high-skilled manufacturing and, finally, services--by leapfrogging intermediate steps. India must not turn back now. Rajan and Lamba explain how India can accelerate growth by prioritizing human capital, expanding opportunities in high-skilled services, encouraging entrepreneurship, and strengthening rather than weakening its democratic traditions. It can chart a path based on ideas and creativity even at its early stage of development. Filled with vivid examples and written with incisive candor, Breaking the Mold shows how India can break free of the stumbling blocks of the past and embrace the enormous possibilities of the future.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289146
289145	1	Putin and the return of history : | how the Kremlin rekindled the Cold War /	Sixsmith, Martin,	An original history of Russia's thousand-year past, tracing the forces and the myths that have shaped Putin's politics and rekindled the Cold War.Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has reshaped history. In the decades after the collapse of Soviet communism, the West convinced itself that liberal democracy would henceforth be the dominant, ultimately unique, system of governance - a hubris that shaped how the West would treat Russia for the next two decades. But history wasn't over. Putin is a paradox. In the early years of his presidency, he appeared to commit himself to friendship with the West, suggesting that Russia could join the European Union or even NATO. He said he supported free-market democracy and civil rights. But the Putin of those years is unrecognisable today. The Putin of the 2020s is an autocratic nationalist, dedicated to repression at home and anti-Western militarism abroad. So, what happened? Was he lying when he proclaimed his support for freedom, democracy and friendship with the West? Or, was he sincere? Did he change his views at some stage between then and now? And if that is the case, what happened to change him?Putin and the Return of History examines these questions in the context of Russia's thousand-year past, tracing the forces and the myths that have shaped Putin's politics of aggression: the enduring terror of encirclement by outsiders, the subjugation of the individual to the cause of the state, the collectivist values that allow the sacrifice of human lives in battle, the willingness to lie and deceive, the co-opting of religion and the belief in Great Russia's mission to change the world.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289145

What does your mobile phone have to do with wind turbines? And can your morning coffee really power a bus? Economics affects every aspect of our lives, from the clothes on our backs to the bread on our tables and the fuel in our cars. And there are huge changes afoot as the global green revolution sweeps across the globe. In this vibrant and eye-opening book, economist and broadcaster Dharshini David follows the course of an average day - from the moment we flick on the light in the morning - to reveal the green changes that are already taking place in every aspect of our world.

And we are rushing headlong into the age of AI-a new information network that threatens to annihilate us. For all that we have accomplished, why are we so self-destructive? Nexus looks through the long lens of human history to consider how the flow of information has shaped us, and our world. Taking us from the Stone Age, through the canonization of the Bible, early modern witch-hunts, Stalinism, Nazism, and the resurgence of populism today, Yuval Noah Harari asks us to consider the complex relationship between information and truth, bureaucracy and mythology, wisdom and power.

289142	1	Classified! : | the adventures of a molehunter /	West, Nigel,	Over the past fifty years, Nigel West has been involved in almost every espionage-related investigation, breakthrough or revelation that you can think of. His mole hunts have led to the unmasking of spies within MI5, MI6 and the CIA and the identification of numerous others - some of whom were crucial to the Allied victory in the Second World War and would have died without any public recognition if not for him. His first encounter with the intelligence community was a lecture given at his school by John le Carré, the guest of a Benedictine monk who had recently retired from MI6. Later, West worked as a researcher for SOE agent Ronnie Seth, who was sentenced to death by the Nazis after being captured during Operation blunderhead, and exposed two of the Cambridge spies recruited by Anthony Blunt. For the fortieth anniversary of the D-Day landings, West traced the double agent codenamed garbo and brought him to London so he could be decorated at Buckingham Palace. As action-packed as the lives of the spies he has written about, this is the story of the most enthralling and significant post-war intelligence revelations as told by Britain's most authoritative writer on espionage and the secret services.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289142
289141	1	How sanctions work : | Iran and the impact of economic warfare /	Bajoghli, Narges,	"Sanctions have enormous consequences. Especially when imposed by a country with the economic influence of the United States, sanctions induce clear shockwaves in both the economy and political culture of the targeted state, and in the everyday lives of citizens. But do economic sanctions induce the behavioral changes intended? Do sanctions work in the way they should ? To answer these questions, the authors of How Sanctions Work highlight Iran, the most sanctioned country in the world. Comprehensive sanctions are meant to induce uprisings or pressures to change the behavior of the ruling establishment, or to weaken its hold on power. But, after four decades, the case of Iran shows the opposite to be true: sanctions strengthened the Iranian state, impoverished its population, increased state repression, and escalated Iran's military posture toward the U.S. and its allies in the region. Instead of offering an 'alternative to war,' sanctions have become a cause of war. Consequently, this book reveals how necessary it is to understand how sanctions really work"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289141
289140	1	Why war? /	Overy, R. J.,	"An Economist Best Book of 2024 Why has war been such a consistent presence throughout the human past? A leading historian explains, drawing on rich examples and keen insight.    Richard Overy is not the first scholar to take up the title question. In 1931, at the request of the League of Nations, Albert Einstein asked Sigmund Freud to collaborate on a short work examining whether there was "a way of delivering mankind from the menace of war." Published the next year as a pamphlet entitled Why War?, it conveyed Freud's conclusion that the "death drive" made any deliverance impossible--the psychological impulse to destruction was universal in the animal kingdom. The global wars of the later 1930s and 1940s seemed ample evidence of the dismal conclusion.    A preeminent historian of those wars, Overy brings vast knowledge to the title question and years of experience unraveling the knotted motivations of war. His approach is to separate the major drivers and motivations, and consider the ways each has contributed to organized conflict. They range from the impulses embedded in human biology and psychology, to the incentives to conflict developed through cultural evolution, to competition for resources--conflicts stirred by the passions of belief, the effects of ecological stresses, the drive for power in leaders and nations, and the search for security. The discussions show remarkable range, delving deep into the Neolithic past, through the twentieth-century world wars, and up to the current conflict in Ukraine. The examples are absorbing, from the Roman Empire's voracious appetite for resources to the impulse to power evident in Alexander the Great, Napoleon, and Hitler. The conclusion is not hopeful, but Overy's book is a gift to readers: a compact, judicious, engrossing examination of a fundamental question.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289140
289139	1	AI needs you : | how we can change AI's future and save our own /	Harding, Verity,	"An electrifying vision of how we can safeguard AI's future for the public goodArtificial intelligence may be the most transformative technology of our time. As AI's power grows, so does the need to figure out what-and who-this technology is really for. AI Needs You argues that it is critical for society to take the lead in answering this urgent question and ensuring that AI fulfills its promise.Verity Harding draws inspiring lessons from the histories of three twentieth-century tech revolutions-the space race, in vitro fertilization, and the internet-to empower each of us to join the conversation about AI and its possible futures. Sharing her perspective as a leading insider in technology and politics, she rejects the dominant narrative, which often likens AI's advent to that of the atomic bomb. History points the way to an achievable future in which democratically determined values guide AI to be peaceful in its intent; to embrace limitations; serve purpose, not profit; and to be firmly rooted in societal trust. AI Needs You gives us hope that we, the people, can imbue AI with a deep intentionality that reflects our best values, ideals, and interests, and that serves the public good. AI will permeate our lives in unforeseeable ways, but it is clear that the shape of AI's future-and of our own-cannot be left only to those building it. It is up to us to guide this technology away from our worst fears toward a future that we can trust and believe in"-- ¦ "This brief and accessible book draws lessons from the history and governance of three recent transformative technologies - the space race, in-vitro fertilization (IVF), and the internet - to argue that society can and should take an active role in shaping the future of artificial intelligence (AI). It is a manifesto aimed at empowering the reader to participate in the conversations and political and democratic processes that will determine the intentions of AI, what values and regulations should guide its development, and its future. Artificial intelligence affects most of us every day, from determining what news we read and music we listen to, to influencing credit scores and legal decisions. As computers become smarter, and the amount of data available to train sophisticated algorithms grows, these unprecedented abilities are coming to play an ever more central role in how our society functions. Yet, as important as this new technology is and will be, it is little understood outside of an unaccountable, insular, and hard-to-scrutinize tech community. Creators of AI-driven systems often operate quickly, at large scale, and without any clear sense of societal purpose or understanding of the diversity and complexity of the human condition. As these systems become increasingly powerful, figuring out what, and who, this technology is for is critical, if we want to ensure that advances in AI will advance us as a species, inspire us as a people, and support the delicate fabric of society. What values framework permeates this new technology, which will permeate our lives? What values are needed - to guide us into a future of which we can all be proud? By looking back, Harding shows that science and technology are clearly not neutral, but inherently political, dictated by the human values and preferences of their time. Recognizing this gives us cause for hope; democratic and political judgement can and must be applied to today's scientific breakthroughs, to ensure that the values we all hold dear - not just the values of a few - will guide us into the new frontier. In four thematically structured chapters, in which Harding connects her historical examples to current considerations about AI, the author argues that AI should be peaceful in its intent, embrace limitations, serve purpose not profit, and be rooted in societal trust. History tells us that we can imbue AI with a deep intentionality that aligns with our best and brightest ideals, interests, and values and that serves the public good - but, to make this happen, the public must take part in this conversation"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289139
289138	1	A world of insecurity : | democratic disenchantment in rich and poor countries /	Bardhan, Pranab K.,	An ambitious account of the corrosion of liberal democracy in rich and poor countries alike, arguing that antidemocratic sentiment reflects fear of material and cultural loss, not a critique of liberalism's failure to deliver equality, and suggesting possible ways out. The retreat of liberal democracy in the twenty-first century has been impossible to ignore. From Wisconsin to Warsaw, Budapest to Bangalore, the public is turning against pluralism and liberal institutions and instead professing unapologetic nationalism and majoritarianism. Critics of inequality argue that this is a predictable response to failures of capitalism and liberalism, but Pranab Bardhan, a development economist, sees things differently. The problem is not inequality but insecurity--financial and cultural. Bardhan notes that antidemocratic movements have taken root globally in a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic groups. In the United States, older, less-educated, rural populations have withdrawn from democracy. But in India, the prevailing Hindu Nationalists enjoy the support of educated, aspirational urban youth. And in Europe, antidemocratic populists firmly back the welfare state (but for nonimmigrants). What is consistent among antidemocrats is fear of losing what they have. That could be money but is most often national pride and culture and the comfort of tradition. A World of Insecurity argues for context-sensitive responses. Some, like universal basic income schemes, are better suited to poor countries. Others, like worker empowerment and international coordination, have broader appeal. But improving material security won't be enough to sustain democracy. Nor, Bardhan writes, should we be tempted by the ultimately hollow lure of China's authoritarian model. He urges liberals to adopt at least a grudging respect for fellow citizens' local attachments. By affirming civic forms of community pride, we might hope to temper cultural anxieties before they become pathological.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289138

289134	1	The war below : | lithium, copper, and the global battle to power our lives /	Scheyder, Ernest,	Tough choices loom if the world wants to go green. The United States and other countries must decide where and how to procure the materials that make our renewable energy economy possible. To build electric vehicles, solar panels, cell phones, and millions of other devices means the world must dig more mines to extract lithium, copper, cobalt, rare earths, and nickel. But mines are deeply unpopular, even as they have a role to play in fighting climate change. These tensions have sparked a worldwide reckoning over the sourcing of these critical minerals, and no one understands the complexities of these issues better than Ernest Scheyder, whose exclusive access has allowed him to report from the front lines on the key players in this global battle to power our future							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289134
289133	1	The melting point : | high command and war in the 21st century /	McKenzie, Kenneth F.,	"This book is a first-person account of my seven years searing at the pinnacle of the United States military. As a four-star officer, I commanded United States Central Command during the most significant three years in the history of the modern Middle East"-- ¦ "As the Commander of U.S. Central Command, General Frank McKenzie oversaw some of the most important - and controversial operations in modern U.S. military history. He had direct operational responsibility for the strikes on Qassem Soleimani and two successive leaders of ISIS, the many months of deterrence operations against Iran and its proxies, and the methodical drawdown in Iraq. He directed the noncombatant evacuation operation in Afghanistan, and our final withdrawal from that tortured country. The Melting Point has three themes. The first one is the importance of the primacy of civilian control of the military. It has become a widely perceived truth that this control has been eroded over the past few years. General McKenzie doesn't believe that to be the case, and he speaks with some authority on the matter arguing that the civ-mil relationship isn't perfect or frictionless, but it doesn't have to be, and probably shouldn't be. It is, however, more durable than many believe, and is supported and embraced by the military to a degree that some critics do not choose to recognize. The second theme is the uniqueness of being a combatant commander. Combatant commanders participate in the development of policy, although as junior partners. They are also responsible for the execution of policy once civilian leaders have formulated their decision, a unique position, and very different than the role of a service chief, or even the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. None of these officers are in the chain of command, and they have no ultimate, mortal responsibility or authority for execution. Only the combatant commander stands astride the boundary of decision-making and execution. Finally, the third theme that McKenzie argues is that leaders matter, and the decisions they make have a profound effect on what happens on the battlefield. McKenzie provides an honest assessment of his time in command-describing decisions that were sound, as well as some outcomes he wishes were different. He offers a vivid portrait of leadership in action in one of the most volatile regions of the world"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289133
289132	1	Geoliberal Europe and the test of war /	Youngs, Richard.,	Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed Europe into a new strategic era. The knock-on effects of the war have combined to open a period of reordering across the European continent. European governments and the European Union collectively have begun to fashion policies for this shift, recognizing this to be a pivotal historical moment. Richard Youngs unpacks the different dynamics that have come to characterize European policies in the wake of the war: the nature of EU integration, geopolitical power, defence priorities, European borders, liberal values, the green transition and economic sovereignty. The book looks to the future and outlines the issues and choices with which European governments still need to grapple. Youngs develops the notion of geoliberalism as a way of addressing these challenges and guiding European governments and the EU into the fragile order taking shape in the shadow of Ukraine's war.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289132
289131	1	U.S. naval power in the 21st century : | a new strategy for facing the Chinese and Russian threat /	Sadler, Brent Droste,	"This nation's Cold War and Global War on Terror defense structures need an update. U.S. Naval Power in the 21st Century provides such a framework for the changed world we live in, offering a detailed roadmap that shows how the United States can field a war-winning fleet that can also compete aggressively in peacetime against dangerous competitors unlike any the nation has faced before. Brent Sadler presents a compelling new strategy and organizing approach that he calls naval statecraft, which acknowledges the centrality and importance of the maritime domain. While similar in scale and scope to Cold War containment strategies against the Soviets, naval statecraft is much more. It must be to challenge China's involvement in global supply chains, which gives that country significant financial heft and influence around the world. Unlike what existed during of the Cold War, however, Sadler provides a unique vision for competing with China and Russia. Rather than simply calling for better coordinated U.S. diplomacy, military operations, and economic statecraft, Sadler argues for integrating the levers of national power coherently and in a sustainable way. This is no small feat, and his approach is informed by a long career rich in working with various agencies of government, foreign militaries (including hostile ones), and our allies. It is an approach imminently appropriate to our times but comes with a realization that the nation is not ready for the competition it faces from China and Russia. The book is a valuable contribution to the national debate over how best to respond to China's rise and Russia's antagonisms."							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289131

289129	1	Hidden geopolitics : | governance in a globalized world /	Agnew, John A.,	Geopolitics is not dead, but nor does it involve the same old logic of a world determined by physical geography in a competition between Great Powers. Hidden Geopolitics recaptures the term to explore how the geography of power works both globally and nationally to structure and govern the workings of the global political economy. Globalization, far from its antithesis, is tightly wound up in the assumptions and practices of geopolitics, relating to the scope of regulatory authority, state sponsorship, and the political power of businesses to operate worldwide. Agnew shows how this "hidden" geopolitics and globalization have been vitally connected. He focuses on three moments: the origins of contemporary globalization in the policies pursued by successive US governments and allies after 1945 and its continued relevance even as the US role in the world changes; the close connection between geopolitical history and status of different countries and their relative capacities to exploit the possibilities and limit the costs of globalization; and new regulatory and standard-setting agencies which emerged under the sponsorship of major geopolitical powers but have grown in power and authority as the dominant states have become limited in their ability to manage the explosion of transnational transactions on their own. Agnew argues that it is time to move on from the narrow inter-imperial cast of geopolitics and the foolish policy advice it produces. The old perspective on geopolitics has taken on new life with the rise of national-populist movements in Europe and the United States and the reinvigoration of territorial-authoritarian regimes in Russia and China. Notwithstanding this trend, we must see the contemporary world through the lens of these complex, "hidden" geopolitical underpinnings that Agnew seeks to expose.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289129
289128	1	The secret history of the Five Eyes : | the untold story of the international spy network /	Kerbaj, Richard,	"The Secret History of The Five Eyes: The untold story of the international spy network, is a riveting and exclusive narrative of the most powerful and least understood intelligence alliance, which has been steeped in secrecy since its formation in 1956. Richard Kerbaj, an award-winning investigative journalist and filmmaker, bypasses the usual censorship channels to tell the definitive account of authoritative but unauthorised stories of the Western world's most powerful but least known intelligence alliance made up of the US, Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. As Kerbaj shows, spy stories are never better than when they are true - and these span from 1930s Nazi spy rings to the most recent developments in Ukraine and China. Through personal interviews with world leaders - including British Prime Ministers Theresa May and David Cameron - and more than 100 intelligence officials, this book explores the complex personalities who helped shape the Five Eyes. They include a Scotland Yard detective who became a spymaster and inspired the first exchanges between MI5 and the FBI. An American home economics teacher who helped create one of the most effective programmes to counter Soviet espionage. The CIA's lone officer in Budapest during the Hungarian Revolution. GCHQ's chief during the Edward Snowden intelligence leak. And the Australian politician turned diplomat whose tip-off to the FBI instigated the inquiry into Russia's meddling in the US presidential contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Richard Kerbaj is able to draw from deep inside the secret corridors of power and his unparalleled access spans all 5 countries. Some of the people he has interviewed include former GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban, CIA director General David Petraeus, MI5 director-general Eliza Manningham-Buller, NSA director Admiral Mike Rogers, British National Security Advisor Kim Darroch, ASIO chief Mike Burgess, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service's chief Richard Fadden, and Ciaran Martin, the official who oversaw Britain's assessments on whether the Chinese telecoms firm, Huawei, should have had a role in the creation of the UK's 5G network"--Publisher's description.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289128
289127	1	The weaponisation of everything : | a field guide to the new way of war /	Galeotti, Mark,	"Hybrid War, Grey Zone Warfare, Unrestricted War: today, traditional conflict-fought with guns, bombs, and drones-has become too expensive to wage, too unpopular at home, and too difficult to manage. In an age when America threatens Europe with sanctions, and when China spends billions buying influence abroad, the world is heading for a new era of permanent low-level conflict, often unnoticed, undeclared, and unending. Transnational crime expert Mark Galeotti provides a comprehensive and ground-breaking survey of the new way of war. Ranging across the globe, Galeotti shows how today's conflicts are fought with everything from disinformation and espionage to crime and subversion, leading to instability within countries and a legitimacy crisis across the globe. But rather than suggest that we hope for a return to a bygone era of "stable" warfare, Galeotti details ways of surviving, adapting, and taking advantage of the opportunities presented by this new reality." --							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289127
289126	1	The politics of cybersecurity in the Middle East /	Shires, James,	Cybersecurity is a complex and contested issue in international politics. By focusing on the 'great powers'--the US, the EU, Russia and China--studies in the field often fail to capture the specific politics of cybersecurity in the Middle East, especially in Egypt and the GCC states. For these countries, cybersecurity policies and practices are entangled with those of long-standing allies in the US and Europe, and are built on reciprocal flows of data, capital, technology and expertise. At the same time, these states have authoritarian systems of governance more reminiscent of Russia or China, including approaches to digital technologies centred on sovereignty and surveillance.    This book is a pioneering examination of the politics of cybersecurity in the Middle East. Drawing on new interviews and original fieldwork, James Shires shows how the label of cybersecurity is repurposed by states, companies and other organisations to encompass a variety of concepts, including state conflict, targeted spyware, domestic information controls, and foreign interference through leaks and disinformation. These shifting meanings shape key technological systems as well as the social relations underpinning digital development. But however the term is interpreted, it is clear that cybersecurity is an integral aspect of the region's contemporary politics.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289126
289125	1	How to stage a coup : | and ten other lessons from the world of secret statecraft /	Cormac, Rory,	An engaging and incisive investigation into the shadowy world of secret statecraft and covert action, by a leading expert on the topic. 'A compelling history of the dark arts of statecraft... Fascinating' Jonathan Rugman 'Rich in anecdote and detail.' The Times Today's world is in flux. Competition between the great powers is back on the agenda and governments around the world are turning to secret statecraft and the hidden hand to navigate these uncertain waters. From poisonings to electoral interference, subversion to cyber sabotage, states increasingly operate in the shadows, while social media has created new avenues for disinformation on a mass scale. This is covert action: perhaps the most sensitive - and controversial - of all state activity. However, for all its supposed secrecy, it has become surprisingly prominent - and it is something that has the power to affect all of us. In an enthralling and urgent narrative packed with real-world examples, Rory Cormac reveals how such activity is shaping the world and argues that understanding why and how states wield these dark arts has never been more important.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289125
289124	1	How civil wars start /	Walter, Barbara F.,	"A leading political scientist examines the dramatic rise in violent extremism around the globe and sounds the alarm on the increasing likelihood of a second civil war in the United States. Political violence rips apart several towns in southwest Texas. A far-right militia plots to kidnap the governor of Michigan and try her for treason. An armed mob of Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists storms the U.S. Capitol. Are these isolated incidents? Or is this the start of something bigger? Barbara F. Walter has spent her career studying civil conflict in places like Iraq and Sri Lanka, but now she has become increasingly worried about her own country. Perhaps surprisingly, both autocracies and healthy democracies are largely immune from civil war; it's the countries in the middle ground that are most vulnerable. And this is where more and more countries, including the United States, are finding themselves today. Over the last two decades, the number of active civil wars around the world has almost doubled. Walter reveals the warning signs-where wars tend to start, who initiates them, what triggers them-and why some countries tip over into conflict while others remain stable. Drawing on the latest international research and lessons from over twenty countries, Walter identifies the crucial risk factors, from democratic backsliding to factionalization and the politics of resentment. A civil war today won't look like America in the 1860s, Russia in the 1920s, or Spain in the 1930s. It will begin with sporadic acts of violence and terror, accelerated by social media. It will sneak up on us and leave us wondering how we could have been so blind. In this urgent and insightful book, Walter redefines civil war for a new age, providing the framework we need to confront the danger we now face-and the knowledge to stop it before it's too late"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289124

289122	1	Mythologies without end : | the US, Israel, and the Arab-Israeli conflict, 1917-2020 /	Slater, Jerome,	"Every nation has narratives or stories it tells itself about its history, but which typically contain factually false or misleading mythologies that often result in devastating consequences for itself and for others. In the case of Israel and its indispensable ally, the United States, the central mythology is "the Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity," as the Israeli diplomat Abba Eban famously said in a 1973 statement that has been widely quoted ever since. However, the historical truth is very nearly the converse: it is Israel and the U.S. that have repeatedly lost or deliberately dismissed many opportunities to reach fair compromise settlements of the Arab-Israeli and Israeli-Palestinian conflicts. The book reexamines the entire history of the conflict from its onset at the end of WWI through today. Part I begins with a reconsideration of Zionism and then examines the origins and early years of the Arab-Israeli state conflict. One chapter is devoted to the question of what accounts for the nearly unconditional U.S. support of Israel throughout the entire conflict. Part II focuses on war and peace in the Arab-Israeli state conflict from 1948 through today, arguing that all the major wars-in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1973--could and should have been avoided. This section also includes an examination of the Cold War and its impact on the Arab-Israeli conflict. Part III covers the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from 1917 through today, and examines the prospects for a two-state or other settlement of the conflict"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289122
289121	1	The politics of maps : | cartographic constructions of Israel/Palestine /	Leuenberger, Christine,	"This book traces how the geographical sciences have become entwined with politics, territorial claim making, and nation-building in Israel/Palestine. In particular, the focus is on the history of geographical sciences before and after the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, and how surveying, mapping, and naming the new territory become a crucial part of its making. With the 1993 Oslo Interim Agreement, Palestinians also surveyed and mapped the territory allocated to a future State of Palestine, with the expectation that they will, within five years, gain full sovereignty. In both cases, maps served to evoke a sense of national identity, facilitated a state's ability to govern, and helped delineate territory. Besides maps geopolitical functions for nation-state building, they also become weapons in map wars. Before and after the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, maps of the region became one of the many battlefields in which political conflicts over land claims and the ethno-national identity of this contested land were being waged. Aided by an increasingly user-defined mapping environment, Israeli and Palestinian governmental and non-governmental organizations increasingly relied on the rhetoric of maps in order to put forth their geopolitical visions. Such struggles over land and its rightful owners in Israel/Palestine exemplify processes underway in other states across the globe, whether in South Africa or Ukraine, which are engaged in disputes over territorial boundaries, national identities, and the territorial integrity of nation-states. Maps, no less, have become crucial tools in these struggles"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289121

Published in association with the United Nations, this book builds on the existing body of literature on gender and democratization by looking at the relevance of national machineries for the advancement of women. It considers the appropriate mechanisms through which the mainstreaming of gender can take place, and the levels of governance involved; defines what the interests of women are, and how and by what processes these interests are represented to the state policy making structures. Global strategies for the advancement of women are considered, and how far these have penetrated at national level, illuminated by a series of case studies - gender equality in Sweden and other Nordic countries, the Ugandan ministry of Gender, Culture and Social services, gender awareness in Central and Eastern Europe, and further examples from South Korea, the Lebanon, Beijing and Australia.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289112
289111	1	Half the battle : | Civilian Morale in Britain During the Second World War /	Mackay, Robert,	This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. How well did civilian morale stand up to the pressures of total war and what factors were important to it? This book rejects contentions that civilian morale fell a long way short of the favourable picture presented at the time and in hundreds of books and films ever since. While acknowledging that some negative attitudes and behaviour existed-panic and defeatism, ration-cheating and black-marketeering-it argues that these involved a very small minority of the population. In fact, most people behaved well, and this should be the real measure of civilian morale, rather than the failing of the few who behaved badly. The book shows that although before the war, the official prognosis was pessimistic, measures to bolster morale were taken nevertheless, in particular with regard to protection against air raids. An examination of indicative factors concludes that moral fluctuated but was in the main good, right to the end of the war. In examining this phenomenon, due credit is accorded to government policies for the maintenance of morale, but special emphasis is given to the 'invisible chain' of patriotic feeling that held the nation together during its time of trial.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289111
289109	1	Fifteen into one? /		This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. This book takes up traditional approaches to political science. It aims to offer a mixture of conventional and specific analyses and insights for different groups of readers. In view of the European Union's multi-level and multi-actor polity, the book highlights the complex procedural and institutional set-up of nation states preparing and implementing decisions made by the institutions of the European Community (EC). In looking at the emerging and evolving realities of the European polity, it shows how European institutions and Member States (re-)act and interact in a new institutional and procedural set-up. It explores how governmental and non-governmental actors in different national settings adapt to common challenges, constraints and opportunities for which they are mainly themselves responsible. The book discusses the Belgian policy toward European integration as a significant demonstration of its commitment to multilateralism and international co-operation in security and economic affairs. Attitudes to European integration in Denmark, Germany, Finland, Greece, and Spain are discussed. Tendencies towards 'Europeanisation' and 'sectoralisation' of the ministerial administration during the process of European integration and the typical administrative pluralism of the Italian political system seem to have mutually reinforced each other. Strong multi-level players are able to increase their access and influence at both levels and to use their position on one level for strengthening their say on the other. German and Belgian regions might develop into these kinds of actors. A persistent trend during the 1990s is traced towards stronger national performers, particularly in terms of adaptations and reactions to Maastricht Treaty.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289109

This book provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the five main parties of the extreme right in the Netherlands (Centrumdemocraten, Centrumpartij), Belgium (Vlaams Blok), and Germany (Die Republikaner, Deutsche Volksunion). Using primary research - including internal party documents - it concludes that rather than right-wing and extremist, the core ideology of these parties is xenophobic nationalist, including also a mix of law and order and welfare chauvinism. The author's research and conclusions have broader implications for the study of the extreme-right phenomenon and party ideology in general.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289107

289103	1	Racism in America : | A Reader /		Racism in America has been the subject of serious scholarship for decades. At Harvard University Press, we've had the honor of publishing some of the most influential books on the subject. The excerpts in this volume-culled from works of history, law, sociology, medicine, economics, critical theory, philosophy, art, and literature-are an invitation to understand anti-Black racism through the eyes of our most incisive commentators. Readers will find such classic selections as Toni Morrison's description of the Africanist presence in the White American literary imagination, Walter Johnson's depiction of the nation's largest slave market, and Stuart Hall's theorization of the relationship between race and nationhood. More recent voices include Khalil Gibran Muhammad on the pernicious myth of Black criminality, Elizabeth Hinton on the link between mass incarceration and 1960s social welfare programs, Anthony Abraham Jack on how elite institutions continue to fail first-generation college students, Mehrsa Baradaran on the racial wealth gap, Nicole Fleetwood on carceral art, and Joshua Bennett on the anti-Black bias implicit in how we talk about animals and the environment. Because the experiences of non-White people are integral to the history of racism and often bound up in the story of Black Americans, we have included writers who focus on the struggles of Native Americans, Latinos, and Asians as well. Racism in America is for all curious readers, teachers, and students who wish to discover for themselves the complex and rewarding intellectual work that has sustained our national conversation on race and will continue to guide us in future years.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289103

288846	1	Community Energy and Sustainable Energy Transitions : | Experiences from Ethiopia, Malawi and Mozambique /		This open access book engages with the difficulties of delivering community energy in practice, building on practical experiences in Ethiopia, Malawi, and Mozambique. In these countries, where many people face a substantial gap in access rates to electricity, community energy is an alternative to advance universal energy access. This book argues that, besides providing access, community energy is essential for achieving justice and resilience in the transition to sustainable energy. Community energy plays a fundamental role in sustainable energy transitions. Community energy combines off-grid infrastructures with innovative forms of governance to incorporate the perspectives of beneficiaries in the generation and distribution of electricity. Community energy systems have multiple benefits for communities, such as facilitating the adoption of renewable technologies, providing energy access where it is lacking, and building resilience. They also offer societal benefits beyond beneficiary communities, such as providing additional capacity to existing grids, delivering off-grid services where the grid is absent, and bridging on-grid and off-grid systems. Despite its promises, however, the adoption of community energy has been slow. This book presents a feminist-informed perspective on community energy to advance energy justice that puts disadvantaged communities at the centre of the transition. It also explores the room for manoeuvre within existing regulatory systems, supply chains, and delivery systems to facilitate its development. By engaging with existing experiences in community energy, the book demonstrates the potential of communities to gain control over their energy needs and resources and argues for the need to develop a wide range of transdisciplinary skills among policymakers, technicians and communities to deliver a just energy transition. Vanesa Castán Broto is Professor of Climate Urbanism at the University of Sheffield. She is Principal Investigator of the project Community Energy And Sustainable Energy Transitions In Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique (CESET), funded by the UK Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF). The project has built a collaborative, multi-institutional partnership bringing together a network of researchers across Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, and the UK to discuss social-oriented alternatives to deliver sustainable energy futures.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288846

288842	1	Webfare : | A Manifesto for Digital Well-Being /	Ferraris, Maurizio,	From time immemorial, humans have been making deals, consuming goods, cultivating interests, thereby manifesting specific forms of life. Now, these forms of life solidify automatically by transforming into data. Webfare, a form of digital welfare, seeks to initiate a Copernican revolution that places need instead of merit at the center of society. In 21st-century welfare, consumption and production will be considered as the two faces of the same reality. The possibility to create new value is precisely what sets Webfare apart from traditional welfare: it recognizes the new value created by the Web, and aims to use it for everyone's well-being.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288842

288840	1	Globalization in State Socialist East Central Europe : | Looking Beyond Dominant Narratives /	Tomka, Béla,	This open access Palgrave Pivot explores four major aspects of globalization: foreign trade, capital and information flows, and the movement of people. The book examines how the state socialist countries of East Central Europe fit into the general trend of globalization after WWII. It focuses on three specific countries in the region: Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. The study also considers conceptual problems: whether recently introduced terms such as 'alternative globalization' and 'socialist proto-globalization' are plausible for interpreting state socialist globalization. Special attention is paid to the study of continuities and discontinuities in the process of globalization in East Central Europe, which is a key issue in current debates. This requires a long-term perspective, so the study covers not only the decades before 1989 but also subsequent developments. In doing so, the book attempts to find a balance between old and new mainstream interpretations: it recognises that East Central European societies experienced considerable globalization during the state socialist era; however, based on empirical findings, instead of 'alternative' or 'proto-' globalization, the book suggests other notions to conceptualize this process, including fragmentation, selectivity, and unevenness. Thus, the proposed understanding could also contribute to discussions on globalization beyond East Central Europe. Béla Tomka is a professor of Contemporary Social and Economic History at the University of Szeged, Hungary. He is the author of 16 books including Welfare in East and West (2004), A Social History of Twentieth-Century Europe (2013, winner of 'Outstanding Academic Title 2013 Award' by Choice, American Library Association), Austerities and Aspirations: A Comparative History of Growth, Consumption and Quality of Life in East Central Europe since 1945 (2020), and the editor of several other volumes.

Whether you're new to the subject or not, a decision-maker, a practitioner or simply a AI user, this book will help you gain a better understanding of HCAI's impact on our societies. ¦  "Artificial intelligence (AI) permeates our lives in a growing number of ways. Relying solely on traditional, technology-driven approaches won't suffice to develop and deploy that technology in a way that truly enhances human experience. A new concept is desperately needed to reach that goal. That concept is Human-Centered AI (HCAI). With 23 captivating chapters, this book delves deep into the realm of HCAI. In Section 1, it demystifies HCAI, exploring cutting-edge trends and approaches in its study, including the moral landscape of Large Language Models. Section 2 looks at how HCAI is viewed in different institutions-like the justice system, health system, and higher education-and how it could affect them. It examines how crafting HCAI could lead to better work. Section 3 offers practical insights and successful strategies to transform HCAI from theory to reality, for example, studying how using regulatory sandboxes could ensure the development of age-appropriate AI for kids. Finally, decision-makers and practitioners provide invaluable perspectives throughout the book, showcasing the real-world significance of its articles beyond academia. Authored by experts from a variety of backgrounds, sectors, disciplines and countries, this engaging book offers a fascinating exploration of Human-Centered AI. Whether you're new to the subject or not, a decision-maker, a practitioner or simply a AI user, this book will help you gain a better understanding of HCAI's impact on our societies, and of why and how AI should really be developed and deployed in a human-centered future".							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288834

288720	1	Critically capitalist : | the spirit of asset capitalism in South Korea /	Kim, Bohyeong.,	Critically Capitalist presents an ethnography of South Korea's asset seekers, including amateur stock investors, real estate enthusiasts, and money coaches, to demonstrate how financialized asset capitalism is sustained. As they hunt for profit margins, rent, and dividends, they simultaneously critique capitalism and posit their pursuit of assets as a form of resistance. Bohyeong Kim theorizes this new spirit of capitalism in South Korea as "critical capitalism," arguing that it reflects the popular discontent with both national development and financial neoliberalism. As a paradoxical critique and legitimation, Bohyeong Kim argues that critical capitalism valorizes the capitalist economy not through a triumphant narrative, but by highlighting the emotional wounds, destroyed communities, and oppressive tactics of modern capitalism. Drawing on multi-sited ethnography and in-depth interviews with a broad community of aspiring millionaires, Critically Capitalist illuminates how contemporary capitalism thrives by channeling discontent into financial and real estate markets, which in turn, has cemented critical capitalism as the cultural and affective backbone of South Korea's economy.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288720
288716	1	Pushing the Paradigm of Global Water Security : | Transnational Perspectives for the Next Generations /	Anker, Victoria.	This book brings together early career researchers, non-governmental organisations and industry practitioners, indigenous and local communities, and government agency workers to interrogate the concept of water security. By collating their multicultural perspectives, diverse contributions, and illustrative media, we challenge the current anthropocentric, technocratic narrative of water security, according to which: water security is solely for humans; development initiatives and interventions are driven by neocolonial and neoliberal ideologies; the socio-cultural approach to water security is secondary to a technical, engineering-based approach; and interdisciplinarity is not practical in its application. Presented here is an amalgamation of our personal and professional efforts to address these challenges. The nuance of this book is in our methodology: transnational cooperation, collaboration across disciplines, and diagnostic problem-solving. While we do not promise a single solution (there is no such thing as 'one size fits all'), we believe this timely contribution broadens the discussion around water security through its firm rejection of reductionist approaches to this most complex of 'wicked problems'. Most notably, we push for the radical acceptance of the indivisibility of environmental conservation, social stability, and economic vitality. We resist the temptation of 'green growth', recognising it as little more than neoliberalism in disguise. The brilliance, innovation, and recall to tradition that emerge through this book demonstrate the importance of solutions that are informed by a plurality of knowledge types (from scientific and technical to indigenous and local) and generated through collaboration and partnerships to support the attainment of socio-ecological justice. Essential reading for water practitioners, policy makers, and multilateral organisations in the development sector, it is also a must-read for doctoral and master's students working at intersections of water, and undergraduates who want to challenge their subject-specific perspectives on water and push disciplinary boundaries.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288716

This insight has led to an embryonic stage of new theorizing, empirical research, and the formation of new technologies, standards, practices, and concepts to ensure the availability of adequate 'paradata' - data on the making and processing of data. This edited volume aims to provide a cross-disciplinary overview of perspectives on the concept and phenomenon of paradata and its implications for research and practice.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288715
288714	1	Post-Truth Populism : | A New Political Paradigm /	Newman, Saul.	This open access book analyses the convergence between 'post-truth' political culture and the politics of populism. The premise is that there is an intrinsic link between post-truth discourse (referring to mis/disinformation, 'alternative facts', 'fake news', conspiracy theories and the general distrust of expert knowledge and official sources of information) and the central narrative of populism, which opposes the 'common sense' wisdom of ordinary honest people to the 'expert knowledge' of duplicitous technocratic elites. The book investigates the current post-truth phenomenon as a distinct feature of contemporary political life, and the specific ways in which it intersects with the resurgence of populism. While there has been a considerable literature on both post-truth and populism, they are largely treated as separate phenomena, and very little research has been conducted on their actual connection. The original contribution of this book to an emerging field of study is to develop a strong, coherent and empirically informed theoretical framework for understanding the specific paradigm of post-truth populism. The authors propose this paradigm as a way of interpreting different contemporary political phenomena, such as conspiracy theories, political destabilisation, and debates around immigration, the role of journalists and the media, climate change, gender and sexuality, Islam, and minority rights, as well as a way of understanding the threats and challenges this poses to the liberal democratic model and way of life.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288714

288711	1	Big Earth Data in Support of the Sustainable Development Goals (2022) - China : | Utilizing Technology for Global Impact /	Guo, Huadong.	This open access book showcases the innovative practices of Big Earth Data methods through a collection of comprehensive case studies from China to monitor and evaluate indicators for seven SDGs, i.e., zero hunger (SDG 2), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), climate action (SDG 13), life below water (SDG 14), life on land (SDG 15), and to analyze the interactions among multiple SDGs indicators.The emphasis on Big Earth Data is highly relevant within the context of growing global challenges. Disaster risk mitigation, climate change, global food security, resource management, and environmental challenges all are interlinked through earth systems and processes that are independent of human constructs. Therefore, these case studies highlight methods and practices of spatial information mining and integrated SDG evaluation, which include evaluating the synergy and trade-off relationships among the SDGs in the context of their correlations; simulating multiple indicators' interactions in future environmental, economic and social scenarios in the context of their temporal variations; designing integrated evaluations of regional SDGs in the context of experience with the study of multiple indicators. Big Earth Data therefore has the potential to support informed policy and decision support at global, regional, and local scales.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288711
288710	1	Turbulence Across the Sea : | Transatlantic Relations and Strategic Competition /	Baranets, Elie.	Great Power competition is back. On the two sides of the Atlantic, however, this concept often means different things. While the United States is focused on China, Europe is preoccupied with Russia. Yet shifting American priorities toward Asia requires reconceptualizing the future role of NATO. In Europe, this shift has led to serious thought about how to achieve strategic autonomy that will allow Europe to guarantee its own security regardless of strategic choices made in Washington. As Chinese strategy focuses on dividing European actors and making them more economically dependent on Beijing, these developments may undermine Washington's influence in Europe while limiting potential European action against Chinese interests. With a mix of research methodologies applied by scholars from both sides of the Atlantic, Turbulence Across the Sea offers a comprehensive analysis of relations among European and North American actors in the context of strategic competition among the United States, Europe, Russia, and China. In doing so, it demonstrates that a reaffirmation of transatlantic cooperation is necessary to maintain security in the face of aggressive moves by both Russia and China. By analyzing attitudes from the perspective of both the various actors (Britain, France, Germany, and the European Union) and various sectors (intelligence cooperation, foreign direct investments, technology, and the defense industry), this book provides readers with a comprehensive perspective on the challenges and opportunities in the shifting landscape of security in the twenty-first century.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288710
288709	1	Influencer Politics : | At the Intersection of Personal, Political, and Promotional /	Arnesson, Johanna.	Influencer Politics focuses on current discussions about the role and impact of social media influencers in the political sphere, and how the personal, political and promotional often converges in digital media. A key question is how core ideas of influencer culture - authenticity, intimacy, commercialism, and self-branding - shape the ways in which politics are expressed and understood in this context, as well as opens up space for new ways of connecting and interacting with the public. It also highlights the way that influencer culture itself is infused with politics, where issues of, for example, empowerment and exploitation are articulated and discussed in different ways.

To highlight proximate connections as well as resonances with debates elsewhere, it includes premodern contributions from the region as well as Jewish thought from Europe that have provided significant references for modern appropriations of secularity.The texts, for the most part previously untranslated, reflect commonalities within the region as well as its great diversity. Thus, while Islam is a common reference for most of our authors, the selections point to its varied invocations in the interest of differing political ends. Others write from a Christian or Jewish perspective, or subscribe to non-religious intellectual traditions. They range from premodern Muslim jurisprudents and philosophers to Ottoman statesmen, Arab socialist and nationalist intellectuals of the interwar period, Iranian revolutionaries, Israeli novelists, and finally, post-secular intellectuals, lay and religious, predominantly from the former Islamic heartland: modern Arab states and Iran. Several introductions weave together the swathe of topics raised in the discussions, beginning with a schematic presentation of the concerns that undergird the volume's organization.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288708
288707	1	Infections in Surgery : | Prevention and Management /	Bartoli, Stefano.	Infections in surgery, commonly known as surgical site infections (SSIs), are complications that may occur after a surgical procedure. SSIs represent a serious problem leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, highlighting the need for continued efforts to improve surgical practices and reduce their incidence.Several factors can contribute to the development of SSIs: patient-related factors (such as obesity, advanced age, diabetes, immunosuppression, pre-existing infections etc.); preoperative preparation-related factors (such as incomplete skin antisepsis or failure to administer appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis); microbial contamination (despite sterile techniques, microorganisms can infect the surgical site); surgical procedure-related factors (duration and complexity of the surgeries); postoperative care-related factors (such as inadequate wound care or infection control measures).To prevent SSIs, healthcare facilities implement various strategies, including: optimization of patients' conditions before surgery; preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis; strict sterile technique; postoperative wound care; surveillance and monitoring to identify and address SSIs early, preventing their spread and complications.Despite the evidence supporting the effectiveness of best practices, many clinicians fail to implement them, and evidence-based practices that optimize both the prevention and treatment of SSIs tend to be underused, highlighting the importance of ongoing research and improvement in surgical techniques and infection control practices.This open access book provides a practical toolkit for surgeons and intensivists to improve their daily clinical practices in order to reduce the risk of SSIs.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288707
288706	1	Social and Emotional Skills for Better Lives.		Social and Emotional Skills for Better Lives presents results from the OECD's Survey on Social and Emotional Skills (SSES) 2023. SSES is the largest international effort to collect data on these skills among 10- and 15-year-old students.The report explores how the following skills differ by socio-demographic groups and how they relate to key life outcomes: task performance skills (persistence, responsibility, self-control and achievement motivation); emotional regulation skills (stress-resistance, emotional control and optimism); engaging with others skills (assertiveness, sociability and energy); open-mindedness skills (curiosity, creativity and tolerance); and collaboration skills (empathy and trust).The results show that students' social and emotional skills - or 21st century skills - are linked to better life outcomes, including academic success, greater life satisfaction, healthier behaviours, less test and class anxiety, and more ambitious career plans. The Survey also finds that these skills are inequitably distributed among students by age, gender, and socio-economic background.SSES 2023 was conducted in Bulgaria, Chile, Peru, Spain, Mexico, Ukraine, Bogotá (Colombia), Delhi (India), Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Emilia-Romagna (Italy), Gunma (Japan), Helsinki (Finland), Jinan (China), Kudus (Indonesia), Sobral (Brazil) and Turin (Italy). Results are compared to SSES 2019, which took place before the COVID-19 pandemic.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288706

288703	1	EU Foreign Policy in a Fragmenting International Order : | Challenges and Strategies /	Costa, Oriol.	This open access book delves into the responses of EU actors, such as member states, institutions, and political groups in the European Parliament, to the fragmentation of the liberal international order (LIO). The analytical framework adopted in this volume explores the diverse interpretations of this phenomenon and the various political initiatives associated with them. Among these interpretations is the concept of strategic autonomy, which has emerged as a key feature of debates surrounding the EU's adaptation to a fragmented LIO. The contributors examine these dynamics across different issue areas and dimensions of EU foreign policy, encompassing the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), external relations, and the externalization of internal policies. They use the term fragmentation to refer to a bundle of processes affecting the LIO that range from challenges to the universality of human rights to the crisis of global governance instruments, from the bifurcation of tech to protectionist tendencies in trade policies.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288703

288698	1	Event Analytics Across Languages and Communities : | Insights and Innovations /	Marenzi, Ivana.	This open access book presents interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral research results fostering event analytics across languages and communities. It is based on the CLEOPATRA International Training Network, which explored how we analyze and understand the major events that influence and shape our lives and societies, and how they unfold online. This analysis was achieved through various case studies, the development of novel methodologies in fields such as data mining and natural language processing, and the creation of new event-centric datasets aggregated in the Open Event Knowledge Graph (OEKG), a multilingual event-centric knowledge graph that contains more than 1 million events in 15 languages.The book is divided into three parts, focusing on different aspects of event analytics across languages and communities: Part I Event-centric Multilingual and Multimodal NLP Technologies presents five chapters reporting on recent developments in NLP technologies required to process multilingual information. Next, the four chapters of Part II: Event-centric Multilingual Knowledge Technologies discuss technologies integrating multilingual event-centric information in knowledge graphs and providing user access to such information. Finally, Part III: Event Analytics covers three selected aspects of multilingual event analytics, namely an analysis of event-centric news spreading barriers, claim detection in social media, and the narrativization of events as a means of presenting event data.This book is mainly written for researchers in academia and industry, who work on topics like natural language processing, large language models, multilingual information retrieval or event analytics.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288698
288697	1	Automatic Imitation : | The Mechanisms of Mimicry /	Genschow, Oliver.	People spontaneously imitate a wide range of different behaviors. The interest in this phenomenon dates back to at least the 18th century when Adam Smith (1759) argued that imitation can be seen as a primitive form of sympathy. Despite the longstanding interest, it was not until the 20th century that different research fields within psychology and neuroscience started empirically investigating this social phenomenon. This book brings together leading researchers from various domains to provide readers with a recent overview of developments in automatic imitation research.   This is an open access book.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288697
288696	1	From Electronic to Mobile Government : | The Development of Digital Public Services /	Homburg, Vincent.	The open access book combines insights from policy sciences (backgrounds of cross-border coordination challenges), design science (development of architectures for mobile services), information ethics (privacy and security of e-government services in international arenas) and business studies (changes in existing business models). The notably interdisciplinary character provides scholars and policy professionals working in specific (legal, political, engineering) disciplines a unique outlook on how policy making, implementation, and pilots are related in multi-level and cross-border governance. The book presents the results of the EU-funded "Mobile Cross-Border Government Services for Europe" (mGov4EU) project in which various pilots implemented and validated enhanced infrastructure services for electronic voting, smart mobility, and mobile signing. Together, the single pilots demonstrated how enhanced electronic identities and trust services (eIDAS) and Single Digital Gateway Regulation (SDGR) layers can accommodate once-only, digital-by-default and mobile-first principles. By taking advantage of security features of modern smartphones like hardware-backed secure elements together with integrated convenience elements like biometric sensors, this research showed how both the security needs and data-protection expectations one has into public services and the usability challenges that arise when accessing complex services using constrained mobile devices meet. This book is the first one in his kind to address this gap in the academic knowledge, as well as this gap in available compendiums for policy professionals at European levels of decision-making, as well as for policymakers and experts working on electronic identification, cross-border and cross-sector information exchange in the various member states of the European Union. This way, it serves various audiences: first, researchers in informatics-related areas like information systems, electronic government, and mobile applications, as it describes empirical examples of secure, easy-to-use and cross-border electronic services that have been developed and successfully tested in practice. Second, it also caters to researchers in international relations or political science as well as policymakers and politicians, both at national or European levels, who are involved in drafting policies and implementing European initiatives in relation to the building blocks of next-generation e-government services.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288696
288695	1	Qatar's nation branding and soft power : | exploring the effects on national identity and international stance /	Al-Tamimi, Nawaf,	This open access book examines how creating a national brand assisted Qatar in absorbing the shock and awe following the outburst of the crisis with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates in May 2017. The authors discuss the country's diplomatic performance, which was characterized by five main factors that helped Qatar to deal with the crisis successfully. These factors include the failure of the element of surprise, years of building Qatar's national brand, Qatar's arsenal of soft power, international alliances, and the opponents' quandary. This book further scrutinizes Qatar's role in the region and all questions related to this role through the lenses of its nation brand. The book provides explanations for the success of Qatar in absorbing the "shock and awe" in the early stage of the last Gulf crisis, presenting various arguments on how establishing a nation brand helped Qatar to deal with the crisis successfully. The book follows an original approach that views the Qatari case from a scientific perspective, investigating the art of nation branding. It will appeal to students, researchers, and scholars of international relations, psychology, political science, and journalism, as well as policy-makers interested in a better understanding of soft power, nation branding, Middle East studies, and diplomacy							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288695
288680	1	The Trump carnival : | populism, transgression and the far right /	Gaufman, Elizaveta,	Donald Trump's campaign and presidency represented a radical departure from political norms that are often classified by media and researchers as 'populist'. Instead, this book theorizes Trump's campaign and presidency with reference to Mikhail Bakhtin's "carnival" - a medieval festival of transgression, ridicule, and renewal. In this book, Lisa Gaufman and Bharath Ganesh provide a closer insight into the Trump Carnival, developing interdisciplinary perspectives on populism, misogyny, misinformation, and far-right vernacular culture. Building on the idea of the carnivalesque, this book focuses on the laughing culture of the Trump campaigns and presidency that vilified minorities, disparaged women, and ultimately emboldened the far right. Bringing Bakhtin into dialogue with key developments in contemporary politics, this book is a must-read for anyone interested in the Trump phenomenon, American politics, and populism.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288680

288389	1	Automation in Communication : | The Ideological Implications of Language Machines /	Wee, Lionel,	By drawing on multiple examples from healthcare, religion, service encounters and poetry, Lionel Wee presents rich insights into the use of automation in communication through a posthumanist lens. As communication becomes increasingly automated, the use of automation creates significant conceptual challenges for ideologies about language, beliefs about the nature of language, as well as assumptions about the roles that interpretation, anthropomorphism, and folk theories of mind play when language is used in communication. This book unravels the ideological implications of automation in communication and provides a new theoretical ground to address the major issues raised by automation. Wee discusses the importance of thinking carefully about how we identify and distinguish the roles of speaker and hearer. He also argues that we re-evaluate our understanding of the relationship between language and community. This book will be vital to students interested in studying the intersections of AI, language and communication, as well as researchers working in communication studies, linguistics and the broader sociology of language in the age of technological change"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288389

288384	1	Arrivals and Departures : | The Human Relationship with Changing Biodiversity /		This book explores the human relationship to changing biodiversity by bringing together multidisciplinary insights into human-nature relations from the humanities. New animal and plant species arrive and previously existing ones may disappear. However, the historical and social perspectives of the changes have been understudied so far. This book approaches the human relationship with changing biodiversity from three different angles: belonging and non-belonging, emotions, and environmental policy. The question of belonging and non-belonging is crucial when it comes to changing biodiversity. The authors ask who decides where species can move and live and when invasive becomes native. Similarly, emotions have a big role in human-nature relations. The book shows why we grieve the loss of some species and hate some other species, and how our emotions change over time. The writers also aim to show how environmental policies, or the practice of governing species, are affected by societal discussion, emotions, scientific research, and topical concepts as well as how these policies shape biodiversity and our perceptions of different species. The authors provide fresh insights into human-nature relations and explain why we need multidisciplinary approaches in order to fully understand their complexity.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288384

288321	1	Soft power and great-power competition : | shifting sands in the balance of power between the United States and China /	Nye, Joseph S.,	This open access book consists of essays selected from Joseph S. Nye, Jr.'s last three decades of writing and illustrate a variety of perspectives on the nature of power, the role of the United States in the world and US-China relations. Through this collection, it is hoped that readers will gain a better understanding of today's global environment and find that while great power competition may be inevitable in a world as centers of power shift, cooperating to address transnational challenges can be a positive sum game. The contents of this book are divided into four main parts. Part One discusses the origins and political progress of the concept of "Soft Power". Part Two explores soft power in the American experience, its sources and interaction with US foreign policy, as well as its ebb and flow in the age of Obama, Trump and Biden. Part Three examines the rise of and the opportunities and difficulties for Chinese soft power, focusing on China's investment in soft power and how this demonstrates its commitment to a peaceful rise. However, it also addresses the question of how can China get "smart" on how it uses soft power. Part Four provides a bird's-eye view of power shifts in the 21st century and the interactions between the US as an established power and China as a rising power, while also reassuring readers that Thucydidean fears are unnecessary and a Cold War is avoidable. Both countries have to realize that some forms of power must be exercised with others, not over others, the development of soft power need not be a zero-sum game. Ultimately, the US-China relationship is a "cooperative rivalry" where a successful strategy of "smart competition" is necessary and cooperation on transnational challenges like climate change, pandemics, cyberterrorism and nuclear proliferation, will serve to benefit not only China and the US, but the world as a whole							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288321

288305	1	Beyond Quantity : | Research with Subsymbolic AI /	Sudmann, Andreas.	How do artificial neural networks and other forms of artificial intelligence interfere with methods and practices in the sciences? Which interdisciplinary epistemological challenges arise when we think about the use of AI beyond its dependency on big data? Not only the natural sciences, but also the social sciences and the humanities seem to be increasingly affected by current approaches of subsymbolic AI, which master problems of quality (fuzziness, uncertainty) in a hitherto unknown way. But what are the conditions, implications, and effects of these (potential) epistemic transformations and how must research on AI be configured to address them adequately?							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288305
288304	1	Algorithmic Regimes : | Methods, Interactions, and Politics /	Jarke, Juliane.	Algorithms have risen to become one, if not the central technology for producing, circulating, and evaluating knowledge in multiple societal arenas. In this book, scholars from the social sciences, humanities, and computer science argue that this shift has, and will continue to have, profound implications for how knowledge is produced and what and whose knowledge is valued and deemed valid. To attend to this fundamental change, the authors propose the concept of algorithmic regimes and demonstrate how they transform the epistemological, methodological, and political foundations of knowledge production, sensemaking, and decision-making in contemporary societies. Across sixteen chapters, the volume offers a diverse collection of contributions along three perspectives on algorithmic regimes: the methods necessary to research and design algorithmic regimes, the ways in which algorithmic regimes reconfigure sociotechnical interactions, and the politics engrained in algorithmic regimes.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288304
288303	1	Digital Media, Denunciation and Shaming : | The Court of Public Opinion /	Trottier, Daniel,	This book offers a common set of concepts to help make sense of online shaming practices, accounting for instances of discrimination and injury that morally divide readers and at times risk unjust and disproportionate harm to those under scrutiny. Digital media denunciation has become a primary form of expression and entertainment across media environments, with new socially desirable forms of accountability under movements such as #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter addressing longstanding forms of systematic and interpersonal abuse. Building on recent scholarship on shaming, surveillance and denunciation in fixed contexts, this study generates a cross-contextual and multi-actor account of practices like 'cancel culture', 'doxing' and 'status degradation ceremonies'. It addresses instances of moral ambivalence by discussing how digital shaming becomes normalised and embedded across socio-cultural and institutional settings. The authors establish key actors and practices in online denunciations of individuals in a range of cases and contexts, including responses to COVID-19, political polarisation, and social justice movements, as well as more local and quotidian circumstances. They draw from empirical data including interviews with nearly 100 individuals targeted by mediated shaming and/or involved in these practices, as well as ethnographic observations of digital vigilantism and discourse analysis of press coverage and online comments relating to online shaming. Diverse applications and contexts, including China, the UK, Russia, and Central Asia, are considered, advancing an ambivalent understanding of media and denunciation that reconciles progressive and regressive practices, as well as celebratory and critical accounts of these practices. This book is recommended reading for advanced students and researchers of online visibility and harm across media studies, cultural studies and sociology.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288303
288302	1	Digital China : | Creativity and Community in the Sinocybersphere /	Imbach, Jessica.	Over the past decade, digital technologies have profoundly reshaped the Chinese cultural landscape. With a focus on the creative agency of new media and online communities, this volume examines this development through the notion of the Sinocybersphere - the networked spaces across the globe that not only operate on the Chinese script, but also imaginatively negotiate the meanings of Chinese culture in the digital age. Instead of asking what makes the internet or new media "Chinese," the chapters situate contemporary entanglements of cultural and digital practices within specific historical, social, and discursive contexts. Covering topics as diverse as live-streaming, AI poetry, online literature, poetry memes, cyberpunk fiction, virtual art exhibitions, cooking videos, censorship, and viral translations, the collection as a whole not only engages with a wide range of Chinese new media phenomena, but also demonstrates their relevance to our understanding of contemporary digital culture.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288302
288301	1	Reflections on the Russia-Ukraine War /	Rothman, Maarten.	The Russia-Ukraine war is a multifaceted beast. It ranges from fighting on the ground to high diplomacy, from domestic anti-war protests to international weapon supplies, from justification through sham referenda to coercion via economic sabotage, and from operational misdirection to covering up war crimes. There are close connections between these facets: the collapse of a front leads to the discovery of mass graves; the delivery of weapon systems depends on Zelensky's appeal to the international community; sham referenda followed by annexation enable accusations of unwillingly mobilized soldiers who refuse to defend the motherland.The volume sheds light on the Russia-Ukraine war, exploring this multitude of facets and their interconnections. Bringing together the expertise of our colleagues at the Netherlands Defense Academy (NLDA) allows us to adopt a distinctively interdisciplinary approach, offering uniquely comprehensive and timely reflections on this armed conflict. The 27 chapters in this volume are centered around five themes. The first section covers historical and contemporary narratives, intelligence, digital technologies, and communication strategies. The second provides in-depth analyses of the operational aspects of the war, including warfighting on land, at sea, in the air, as well as in the space and cyber domains. The third section on international involvement covers topics such as sanctions, burden sharing, arms support and implications of the war on international institutions and the world order. The fourth provides analyses of the normative framework that applies to the Russia-Ukraine war. Finally, the fifth section deals with the way armed forces can transform their organizations and learn from this war, and concludes with questions on how and when the Russia-Ukriane war might end.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288301

The third issue of the Yearbook on the History of Global Development aims at collecting contributions about the role of international organizations in shaping the global system of development throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. International organizations - both intergovernmental and NGOs - have played a crucial role, shaping the global system of development by setting agendas, mobilizing people, and framing ideas and practices regarding development on local, national, regional, and global scales.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288299
288298	1	Urban Terrorism in Contemporary Europe : | Remembering, Imagining and Anticipating Violence /	Karcher, Katharina.	This open access book sheds light on collective practices of remembering, imagining and anticipating in relation to recent acts of urban terrorism in Europe. Analysing a range of personal and collective responses to urban terrorism in contemporary Europe, this book shows that current debates on this issue are shaped by multiple co-existing and intersecting memories of political violence in the past. Moreover, despite public declarations of unity and solidarity, collective memories of urban terror in contemporary Europe are far from consensual - memory can be both a catalyst for and an impediment to social and political change. Drawing on case studies from a range of European countries and creative responses by survivors, artists, and poets, this interdisciplinary volume introduces readers to key methods (e.g. discourse analysis and (auto-)ethnography) and concepts (e.g. Lieux de Mémoire and 'grassroots memorials') for the study of the memoralization of terror attacks.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288298
288297	1	Cold War Europe : | A Space of Communication /	Nanz, Tobias.	The Cold War is often stereotypically depicted as a period of complete separation between Eastern and Western Europe, a time of little communication and exchange between what is often called the "Eastern bloc" and the capitalist West . European integration, it is thought, was a Western project based on exclusively Western ideas. This edited volume aims to debunk this stereotype. It provides evidence for the numerous media and individuals that contributed to the circulation and exchange of ideas across the ideological divide of the Iron Curtain. The essays in this volume discuss the official and unofficial channels of communication between the Eastern bloc and the West as well as the complex networks of transmission and reception that enabled the exchange of ideas between the two. The first part of the volume examines the communication infrastructure of the Cold War and the role of then available communication technologies. The second hones in on how different media channels, and the radio in particular, were used to form and transmit ideas between East and West, whereas the third and final part looks at how individual artists and literary authors made their voices heard across the Iron Curtain.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288297
288239	1	States of surveillance : | ethnographies of new technologies in policing and justice /		"Recent discussions on big data surveillance and artificial intelligence in governance have opened up an opportunity to think about the role of technology in the production of the knowledge states use to govern. The contributions in this volume examine the socio-technical assemblages that underpin the surveillance carried out by criminal justice institutions - particularly the digital tools that form the engine room of modern state bureaucracies. Drawing on ethnographic research in contexts from across the globe, the contributions to this volume engage with technology's promises of transformation, scrutinise established ways of thinking that become embedded through technologies, critically consider the dynamics that shape the political economy driving the expansion of security technologies, and examine how those at the margins navigate experiences of surveillance. The book is intended for an interdisciplinary academic audience interested in ethnographic approaches to the study of surveillance technologies in policing and justice. Concrete case studies provide students, practitioners, and activists from a broad range of backgrounds with nuanced entry points to the debate"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288239
288237	1	Artificial intelligence and evaluation : | emerging technologies and their implications for evaluation /		"Artificial Intelligence and Evaluation: Emerging Technologies and their Implications for Evaluation is a groundbreaking exploration of how the landscape of program evaluation will be redefined by artificial intelligence and other emerging digital technologies. In an era where digital technologies and artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly evolving, this book presents a pivotal resource for evaluators navigating the transformative intersection of their practice and cutting-edge technology.

Offering a discerning overview of various digital technologies, their promises and perils, they carefully dissect the implications for evaluative processes, and debates how evaluators must be equipped with the requisite skills to harness the full potential of AI tools. Further, the book includes a number of compelling use cases, demonstrating the tangible applications of AI in diverse evaluation scenarios. The use cases range from the application of GIS data to advanced text analytics. As such this book provides evaluators with inspirational cases on how to apply AI in their practice as well as what pitfalls one must look out for. Artificial Intelligence and Evaluation is an indispensable guide for evaluators seeking to not only adapt to but thrive in the dynamic landscape of evaluation practices reshaped by the advent of artificial intelligence"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288237
288236	1	Unequal security : | welfare, crime and social inequality /		"We live in an age of insecurity. The Global Financial Crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the climate crisis are just the most evident examples of shocks that have increased the level of insecurity among elites and citizens in recent years. And yet there is ample evidence that insecurity is not equally distributed across populations. Bringing together disciplines such as political science, criminology, sociology, and anthropology and combining quantitative and qualitative studies from a wide range of rich and middle-income countries, this collection presents a new framework for exploring the two key social challenges of our times - insecurity and inequality - together. The volume analyses the nature, causes and distribution of subjective insecurities and how various actors use or respond to unequal security. The essays cover a host of themes including the unequal spatial distribution of (in)security, unequal access to security provision in relation to crime and welfare, the impact of insecurity on political attitudes, as well as policy responses and the political exploitation of insecurity. An important contribution to debates across several social scientific disciplines as well as current public debate on insecurity and politics, the volume will be of great interest to scholars and researchers of criminology, social policy, peace and conflict studies, politics and international relations, sociology, development studies and economics. It will also be of interest to policy-makers and government think tanks"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288236
288235	1	Knowledge and digital technology /		This open access book explores the multifaceted interplay of technology, knowledge, and place. While digital technology is increasingly influencing our way of knowing, conversely it is itself the consequence of human creativity and local social interaction. Part I analyzes how digital technologies transform markets through artificial intelligence and decentralized blockchain models. Its contributions discuss novel governance mechanisms, including the responsible use and analysis of big data. Part II illustrates various ways in which technology supports humanity, be it algorithms supporting complex decision-making processes or the use of robotics in care services. The chapters highlight that technology's efficiency and potential rely on social norms and human capital. Finally, Part III shows that digitization is generating vibrant entrepreneurship, reflected in geographically clustered urban scale-up economies, as well as opening up new ways for people to connect with one another, organize civic engagement and enable new forms of labor. The book offers theoretical reflections as well as empirical cases from the United States, Canada, Japan, South Africa, and Europe.

288234	1	Digital inclusion : | international policy and research /		This collection presents policy and research that addresses digital inequalities, access, and skills, from multiple international perspectives. With a special focus on the impact of the COVID-19, the collection is based on the 2021 Digital Inclusion, Policy and Research Conference, with chapters from both academia and civic organizations. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed citizens relationship with digital technologies for the foreseeable future. Many peoples main channels of communication were transferred to digital services, platforms, and apps. Everything went online: our families, friends, partners, health, work, news, politics, culture, arts and protesting. Yet access to digital technologies remained highly unequal. This brought digital inclusion policy and research to the fore, highlighting to policymakers and the public the hidden challenges and impacts of digital exclusion and inequalities. The cutting-edge volume offers research findings and policy case studies that explore digital inclusion from the provision of basic access to digital, via education and digital literacy, and on to issues of gender and technology. Case studies are drawn from varied sources including the UK, Australia, South America, and Eastern Europe, providing a valuable resource in the pursuit of social equity and justice. Simeon Yates is Professor of Digital Culture at the University of Liverpool (UK) and co-director of the Digital Media and Society Institute. He has undertaken research on the social, political and cultural impacts of digital media since 1990.

287870	1	Epistemic rights in the era of digital disruption /		This open-access volume argues that in a functioning democracy, citizens should be equally capable of making informed choices about matters of social importance. This includes citizens accessing all relevant information and knowledge necessary for informed will formation. In today's complex era of digital disruption, it is not enough to simply speak about communication or even digital rights. The starting point for this volume is the need for 'epistemic equality'. The contributors seek to showcase the history and diversity of current debates around communication and digital rights, as precursors for the need for epistemic rights; both as a theoretical concept and an empirically assessed benchmark. The book highlights scholarship via academic case studies from around the world to feature different issues and methodological approaches, as well as similarities in academic and policy challenges across the globe. The goal is to provide an overview of issues that depict challenges to epistemic rights, extract both academic and applied policy implications of different approaches, and end with a set of recommendations for advancing policy-relevant scholarship on epistemic rights. This volume is intended as the first holistic response to an urgent need to address epistemic rights of communication as a central public policy issue, as an academic analytical concept, as well as a central theme for informed public debate. This book is open-access, meaning you have free and unlimited access.

287853	1	Producing and debating history : | historical knowledge on Wikipedia /	Apostolopoulos, Petros,	In 2021, the American Historical Association published a study on how the American public perceives and understands the past. Almost half of the respondents argued that they turn to Wikipedia to learn about history and acquire a historical understanding of the past. Wikipedia was ranked higher than other historical activities, such as “Historic site visit,” “Museum visit,” “Genealogy work,” “Social media,” “Podcast/radio program,” “History lecture,” and “History-related video game.” These findings combined with the appropriation of Wikipedia’s corpus by ChatGPT and Wikipedia’s partnership with the most central search engine in the digital world, Google, and other digital assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, make clear how crucial the role of Wikipedia in how the public learns about history and makes sense of the past is.    But how is historical knowledge produced on Wikipedia? How do Wikipedia editors engage with historical events of the past and transform the past into historical knowledge? Why do they decide to contribute to the production of history? By placing Wikipedia editors at the center of research inquiry and using multiple methodologies and different kinds of data, this book explores how historical knowledge is produced in one of the most central digital communities of knowledge, Wikipedia.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287853
287843	1	European actorness in a shifting geopolitical order : | European strategic autonomy through differentiated integration /	Rieker, Pernille,	"The successive crises the EU has undergone, notably with the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have highlighted dramatically how European security includes while spans well beyond defence. Picking up from this cue, this book masterfully expands the notion of European strategic autonomy across different areas while highlighting its fundamental compatibility with the goal of building stronger partnerships beyond the EU's borders." - Nathalie Tocci, director at IAI in Rome "European Actorness in a Shifting Geopolitical Context is a timely and thought-provoking contribution to the discourse on European strategic autonomy. Rieker and Giske go beyond conventional notions of defence to highlight the pressing need to address the growing risk of hybrid threats. With meticulous research and a nuanced understanding of contemporary debates on European integration and security, this volume presents a comprehensive approach to fleshing out European strategic autonomy. A must-read for policymakers, academic experts and anyone interested in understanding Europe's evolving role on the international stage." - Mark Leonard, director of ECFR "Rieker and Giske provide an innovative analysis of how external differentiation can help improve EU actorness and security. This is the first study that systematically brings together two core issues in European integration: external differentiation and strategic autonomy. Building on a broad empirical basis, the book makes an important contribution to current political and academic discussions on Europe's foreign and security policy." - Frank Schimmelfennig, Professor, ETH Zurich This is an open access book. Over the past decade, the global geopolitical context has changed significantly, with a geopolitical power shift and a more assertive Russia and China. With the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, European security has been put on high alert. The implications of the Russian military invasion are many and difficult to grasp in full. But the need for greater European strategic autonomy appears increasingly evident. But how can this be achieved in the short run? A common answer to this question is that it is impossible or that this can only be achieved in the long run, if at all. The aim of this book is to present a different perspective. It aims at showing that it should be possible to make the most out of the current European system if we adjust our understanding of how it works. The book argues that strategic autonomy may be reached-also in the short run-if differentiated integration (DI) is seen as an asset rather than a challenge. While the EU remains the core in such a system (together with NATO in the military domain), there is a multitude of other (bilateral and minilateral) regional and sub-regional integration processes that need to be considered to get the full idea of how a more differentiated European strategic autonomy can be achieved. This book starts by presenting a theoretical framework for how to study European actorness beyond the EU (ch.2), then this framework is applied both to understand Europe as a global actor (ch. 3), Europe as an actor in security and defence (ch. 4) and Europe as a regional actor (ch. 5). Pernille Rieker holds a position as a research professor at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) and a part-time full professor at the Inland University College (INN). Rieker is part of NUPI's research group on security and defence and is responsible for NUPI's Center for European Studies (NCE). Furthermore, she is the co-editor of the Scandinavian journal for international studies, 'Internasjonal Politikk'. Mathilde E.

287837	1	Ai in Business and Economics /		Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have generated intense interest and debate about their potential to reshape industries, labour markets and socio-economic structures. This volume presents a collection of academic papers stemming from "The Economic Perspective of Artificial Intelligence" (EPEAI) conference held at the Ruhr West University of Applied Sciences in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany, in March 2023. AI in Business and Economics discusses topics as varied as marketing, accounting, reporting, business narratives, forecasting, generational differences in attitudes, economic policy - all in the context of exploring the multifaceted intersection of economics and artificial intelligence. It navigates through the fog caused by the heterogeneity of diverse AI applications and methodologies by examining artificial intelligence from an economic perspective. In doing so, it becomes clear that the implementation of a broad range of AI technologies in companies has just begun. Businesses, employees, and policy makers will soon have to adapt to the fast-paced advancements in artificial intelligence, ensuring they become and remain competitive, ethical, and forward-thinking in a changing global landscape. This book will serve as a valuable resource for scholars, practitioners, and students exploring the complexities of the economic implications of AI.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287837

Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more.    In a world increasingly shaped by displacement and migration, refuge is both a coveted right and an elusive promise for millions. While conventionally understood as legal protection, it also transcends judicial definitions. In Lived Refuge, Vinh Nguyen reconceptualizes refuge as an ongoing affective experience and lived relation rather than a fixed category with legitimacy derived from the state.     Focusing on Southeast Asian diasporas in the wake of the Vietnam War, Nguyen examines three affective experiences--gratitude, resentment, and resilience--to reveal the actively lived dimensions of refuge. Through multifaceted analyses of literary and cultural productions, Nguyen argues that the meaning of refuge emerges from how displaced people negotiate the kinds of safety and protection that are offered to (and withheld from) them. In so doing, he lays the framework for an original and compelling understanding of contemporary refugee subjectivity.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287560

287552	1	Circular economy realities : | critical perspectives on sustainability /		"This book addresses the realities of the circular economy, a resource efficiency concept that has risen to global prominence in academic, policy and business circles over the last decade. Considered an approach to sustainable growth, the volume critically analyses how sustainable emerging applications of a circular economy are in practice. The book stems from an international, interdisciplinary project exploring the discourses, policies, implementation, and impacts of the circular economy across public, private and third sector accounts. It draws on a wide range of case studies, from the UK, Portugal, Austria, Italy, Netherlands, France, Chile, China, Nigeria, Taiwan and Vietnam, highlighting how experiences both shaped and were shaped by the places in which they were happening. It provides a guide to researching a complex phenomenon such as a circular economy, which involves both collaboration and competition between multiple stakeholders across different sectors and places. Synthesising the multiple perspectives employed in the project, the book makes recommendations for circular economy implementation in different contexts, including the assessment of sustainability implications, whilst indicating the limited potential for circular economy activity to bring social and economic benefits without explicit motivation for those to happen. Benefitting from extensive empirical research, this critical assessment of sustainability in the context of the circular economy will appeal to a broad readership of academics, upper-level students, practitioners and policy-makers in sustainable development, business, economics, geography, sociology and environmental engineering"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287552

They play a crucial role in various spheres, from collecting research data to providing persons in the public eye a platform in print and online media. Interviews do not only capture a dialogue; they provide a framework in which dialogue gets staged. As such a framework, the interview protocols experiential knowledge and personal experience in certain ways, according interlocutors different degrees of authority to speak. The volume contributes state-of-the-art research on what conclusions can be drawn from these and further reflections for a general assessment of the interview as method and form; it offers fundamental conceptualizations of the interview as a structured and mediated site of knowledge production. Theoreticians and practitioners assembled here conceptualize the interview from perspectives in different fields of the humanities and social sciences such as linguistics, literary and cultural studies, musicology, psychology, and philosophy.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287548

It uses accessible and engaging language to help bring an understanding of the issues with nuclear power to a broader sector of the public, with the intention of appealing to non-scientists seeking knowledge on the disadvantages of nuclear power as a solution for climate change. The argument is made that while superficially appealing, nuclear power is too costly, fragile, and slow to implement, compared to alternative options such as wind and solar.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287547
287545	1	Digital sustainability : | leveraging digital technology to combat climate change /		Digitalisation and environmental sustainability are two of the megatrends impacting industry and society. This open access Pivot is a timely exploration of some of the challenges and prospects related to digital sustainability from two main perspectives: how digital technologies can be used and maintained in a way that is environmentally sustainable over the long term (greening of digital technologies), and how digital technologies can be used to address climate change and improve environmental and sustainability outcomes (greening by digital technologies). The chapters included in this book are designed to provide some key definitions and concepts related to digital sustainability and its evolution, and more detailed insights on some of the key priority areas outlined in the European Green Deal, namely energy, mobility, buildings, food and the circular economy. A critical review of these topics will summarise and present different perspectives that challenge old assumptions and highlight emerging trends and possibilities for digital sustainability. Industry and society face significant challenges in the twin transition to digital and green transformation, not least of which is the need to balance investment in digital technologies with environmental sustainability. This open-access book can serve as a primer for scholars, policymakers, and enterprise decision-makers, providing insights on navigating innovation ecosystems to support both green and digital objectives.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287545

287537	1	Preparing for Hybrid Threats to Security : | Collaborative Preparedness and Response /	Borch, Odd Jarl.	This book examines hybrid threats within the broader context of a security crisis in Europe. As geopolitical tensions increase and great power rivalries intensify, can states protect their communities? While conventional wars are fought, parallel battles take place by more subtle and non-violent means. This multi-disciplinary book examines how hybrid threats undermine political governance and social stability in liberal democracies, covering aggressors, targeted states and victimized communities. It seeks to address how aggressor states undermine liberal democracies under the threshold of conflict, and the role played by hybrid threats as aggressor states prepare for full-scale war. The chapters also explore how liberal democracies organize and interact to detect hybrid threats, arguing that, in order to increase resilience, politicians and government agencies must involve the private sector and citizens in threat-reduction policies. The analysis builds upon the latest research in the international crisis management literature. This book will be of interest to students of security studies, hybrid warfare, defence studies and International Relations, as well as professional practitioners.

The leadership and legacy of al-Haq, from its origins in Palestine to its international impact     Established in Ramallah in 1979, al-Haq was the first Palestinian human rights organization and one of the first such organizations in the Arab world. This inside history explores how al-Haq initiated methodologies in law and practice that were ahead of its time and that proved foundational for many strands of today's human rights work in Palestine and elsewhere. Lynn Welchman looks at both al-Haq's history and legacy to explore such questions as: Why would one set up a human rights organization under military occupation? How would one go about promoting the rule of law in a Palestinian society deleteriously served by the law and with every reason to distrust those charged with implementing its protections? How would one work to educate overseas allies and activate international law in defense of Palestinian rights? This revelatory story speaks to the practice of local human rights organizations and their impact on international groups.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287474

Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more.    Since the end of the Cold War, globalization--the process and the idea--has been reshaping the world. Global studies scholarship has emerged to make sense of the transnational manifestations of globalization: economic, social, cultural, ideological, technological, environmental, and postcolonial. But a series of crises in the first two decades of the twenty-first century has put the neoliberal globalization system of the 1990s under severe strain.     Are we witnessing a turn toward "deglobalization," intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine or a moment of "reglobalization," spearheaded by digital technology? The contributors to this book employ transdisciplinary research to assess past developments, the current state, and future trajectories of globalization in light of today's dynamics of insecurity, volatility, and geopolitical tensions.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287467

This book delves into these consequences, providing a fresh and comprehensive guide to understanding them and studying them. The book starts by laying out a theoretical framework based on complexity thinking, before going on to explore the ten most prevalent kinds of unintended effects of foreign aid: backlash effects, conflict effects, migration and resettlement effects, price effects, marginalization effects, behavioural effects, negative spillover effects, governance effects, environmental effects, and ripple effects. Each chapter revolves around a set of concrete case studies, analysing the mechanisms underpinning the unintended effects and proposing ways in which policymakers, practitioners, and evaluators can tackle negative side effects and maximize positive side effects. The book also includes personal testimonies, a succinct overview of unintended effects, and suggestions for further reading.

287440	1	PeaceTech : | digital transformation to end war /	Bell, Christine,	Why are we willing to believe that technology can bring about war but not peace? PeaceTech: Digital Transformation to End War is the world's first book dealing with the use of technological innovation to support peace and transition processes. Through an interwoven narrative of personal stories that capture the complexity of real-time peace negotiation, Bell maps the fast-paced developments of PeaceTech, and the ethical and practical challenges involved. Bell locates PeaceTech within the wider digital revolution that is also transforming the conduct of war. She lays bare the double disruption of peace processes, through digital transformation, and through changing conflict patterns that make processes more difficult to mount. Against this backdrop can digital peacebuilding be a force for good? Or do the risks outweigh the benefits? PeaceTech provides a 12-Step Manifesto laying out the types of practice and commitment needed for successful use of digital tools to support peace processes. This open access book will be invaluable primer for business tech entrepreneurs, peacebuilders, the tech community, and students of international relations, informatics, comparative politics, ethics and law; and indeed for those simply curious about peace process innovation in the contemporary world. Christine Bell is Professor of Constitutional Law. Assistant Principal (Global Justice), and Executive Director of the Peace and Conflict Resolution Evidence Platform (PeaceRep), based at the School of Law, at the University of Edinburgh. A long-time expert and practitioner in the field of peace processes and constitution-making, she manages digital and PeaceTech innovation							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287440
287416	1	Cyber security politics : | socio-technological transformations and political fragmentation /		"This book examines new and challenging political aspects of cyber security and presents it as an issue defined by socio-technological uncertainty and political fragmentation. Structured along two broad themes and providing empirical examples for how socio-technical changes and political responses interact, the first part of the book looks at the current use of cyberspace in conflictual settings, while the second focuses on political responses by state and non-state actors in an environment defined by uncertainties. Within this, it highlights four key debates that encapsulate the complexities and paradoxes of cyber security politics from a Western perspective - how much political influence states can achieve via cyber operations and what context factors condition the (limited) strategic utility of such operations; the role of emerging digital technologies and how the dynamics of the tech innovation process reinforce the fragmentation of the governance space; how states attempt to uphold stability in cyberspace and, more generally, in their strategic relations; and how the shared responsibility of state, economy, and society for cyber security continues to be re-negotiated in an increasingly trans-sectoral and transnational governance space. This book will be of much interest to students of cyber-security, global governance, technology studies, and International Relations"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287416
287415	1	Enhancing global governance in a fragmented world : | prospects, issues, and the role of China /		This open access book explores the 'polycrisis' currently affecting nearly all nations by exploring key themes such as multilateralism and globalization from the perspective of think tanks from nearly every continent, searching for various solutions to the ills that currently plague the world and a way to create a future in which everyone benefits. As China's preeminent non-governmental think tank, the Center for China and Globalization (CCG) has invited 30 leading figures from the global think tank community to sift through the myriad layers of multilateralism and global governance and provide a contextual analysis of major themes both from a theoretical and practical perspective that focus on China in detail, but also examine the world as a whole. Think tanks are essential in analyzing current trends and providing potential solutions that aid governments, international organizations and business in finding solutions that are beneficial to all. As a key source of innovative ideas, they have become even more valuable today as the pace of change accelerates, geopolitical complexity increases and the world has to deal with global crises that no country can address on their own. A common, central theme through all of the 25 essays in this book is the need for a more universal, inclusive and multilateral approach to reforming global governance. It is our hope that the views of the experts from think tanks and other non-governmental organizations in this compilation will provide valuable insights to help heal the gaps in our fragmented world							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287415

287378	1	Regulating the Metaverse economy : | how to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism /	Mooij, Annelieke,	This open access book examines regulating an environment that has no jurisdiction, is fully anonymous and infinitely vast? Welcome to the Metaverse, an online virtual reality that is expected to add billions to the global economy. The Metaverse offers a new type of virtual economy with practically endless business opportunities. The question is how to prevent these opportunities from being abused to commit money laundering and finance terrorism (MLFT). This book explores the current European Union legislation designed to prevent MLFT in connection with the Metaverse. It analyses the legislation in relation to the three traditional stages of MLFT: placement, layering and integration. Furthermore, some additional risks specific to the Metaverse are discussed, such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and the high level of anonymity. The book concludes that the current legislation is not suitable for facing the new challenges of the Metaverse. In turn, the book puts forward a novel approach to regulating and enforcing MLFT legislation: using a system of smart assets equipped with AI to prevent and detect MLFT. In addition, it makes recommendations on how to improve the legal framework with regard to the new challenges arising from the Metaverse. Particular attention is given to creating a legal framework that incorporates the use of smart assets and the Internet of Things, in order to provide a safe environment for potential users and society. With a solid background in financial law and technology, the author successfully creates a novel system of regulation and enforcement that is based on the use of automatic enforcement, whilst keeping sufficient legal safeguards in place for potential Metaverse users. This book will be of interest to anyone interested in the Metaverse. Whether you want to regulate it or open your own virtual business, its a must-read!							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287378

287355	1	Media use in digital everyday life /	Ytre-Arne, Brita.,	The ebook edition of this title is Open Access and freely available to read online. As digital technologies have become ever more ingrained in society, Media Use in Digital Everyday Life asks how our relationship with media has changed. After the proliferation of smartphones, social media and ubiquitous connectivity, what has happened to the ways we navigate across social domains and structure our daily routines? Filling a gap between classic discussions on everyday media use and recent studies of emergent technologies, this book untangles how media become meaningful to us in the everyday, connecting us to communities and publics. With analyses of media use in an ordinary day, as part of life transitions and in times of disruption, Ytre-Arne provides a comprehensive framework for studies of everyday media use, considering dilemmas of technological transformations and recent crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Media Use in Digital Everyday Life offers empirical, methodological and theoretical insight, building on extensive qualitative research and taking a cross-media perspective. Through the conceptual approaches of media repertoires and public connection, the book situates communication and changing media use in everyday contexts, showing how our more digital everyday lives intensify communicative dilemmas. Written in an accessible tone, Media Use in Digital Everyday Life will appeal to readers interested in digital media, and to students and scholars of audiences, datafication, journalism and digital platforms.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287355
287354	1	Mission AI : | the new system technology /	Sheikh, Haroon.,	This open access book offers a strategic perspective on AI and the process of embedding it in society. After decades of research, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now entering society at large. Due to its general purpose character, AI will change society in multiple, fundamental and unpredictable ways. Therefore, the Netherlands Scientic Council for Government Policy (WRR) characterizes AI as a system technology: a rare type of technologies that have a systemic impact on society. Earlier system technologies include electricity, the combustion engine and the computer. The history of these technologies provides us with useful insights about what it takes to direct the introduction of AI in society. The WRR identifies five key tasks to structurally work on this process: demystification, contextualisation, engagement, regulation and positioning. By clarifying what AI is (demystification), creating a functional ecosystem (contextualisation), involving diverse stakeholders (engagement), developing directive frameworks (regulation) and engaging internationally (positioning), societies can meaningfully influence how AI settles. Collectively, these activities steer the process of co-development between technology and society, and each representing a different path to safeguard public values. Mission AI - The New System Technology was originally published as an advisory report for the government of the Netherlands. The strategic analysis and the outlined recommendations are, however, relevant to every government and organization that aims to take up 'mission AI' and embed this newest system technology in our world.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287354

287002	2	الديمقراطية في أميركا /	توكفيل، ألكسي دو،	يتألف مجلد كتاب الديمقراطية في أميركا من جزأين، يشتمل الجزء الأول منهما على قسمين، يضم الأول ثمانية فصول، والثاني عشرة فصول (فالمجموع ثمانية عشر فصلًا)، أما الجزء الثاني فيشتمل على أربعة أقسام، يضم الأول منها واحدًا وعشرين فصلًا، والثاني عشرين فصلًا، والثالث ستة وعشرين فصلًا، والرابع ثمانية فصول (فالمجموع خمسة وسبعون فصلًا). بناء عليه، يكون مجموع فصول الكتاب ثلاثة وتسعين فصلًا، وكفى بهذا العدد من الفصول شاهدًا على عظمة الجهد المبذول في هذا السِّفر الذي خلّفه دو توكفيل للأجيال من بعده. ونحن إذ نَذَرُ القارئَ يخوض الكتاب قراءةً ومتعةً ليستكشف مضامين الفصول، نستعرض فكر دو توكفيل حول مادة الكتاب.    الغرض من تأليف هذا السِّفْر العظيم  قبل كتاب دو توكفيل ذكريات (كُتبت بين 1850 و1851 ونُشرت بعد وفاته)، خصص المؤرخ الفرنسي لمؤلَّفه الديمقراطية في أميركا ما يقارب الألف صفحة لوصف الأمّة التي خلّفت بالمقدار الأقلّ من الدماء ما لم تتمكّن أوروبا من أن تخلّفه بالثورات العنيفة. فرحلةٌ إلى أميركا لأقل من عام بين 1831 و1832 لغرَض الاطلاع على أوضاع السجون فيها جعلته يُبدِع مؤلّفًا خالدًا، لم يخلُ كتابٌ جديّ في العلوم السياسية أو الفلسفة أو الاجتماعيات بعده من الاستناد إلى تحليلاته أو افتراضاته. رأى دو توكفيل في العالم الجديد (أميركا) تجسيدًا للثورة الحقيقية الحتمية، التي تؤسّس من دون عنف لرفاه الإنسان وازدهار مجتمعاته. كان توكفيل يرى أن الانتقال من الأرستقراطية إلى الديمقراطية لا يحتّم المرور بثورات دموية، على غرار ما شهدته فرنسا ومعظم الملكيّات الأوروبية. لكنه لا ينطلق في انكبابه على حال الديمقراطية في أميركا من إعجاب منزّه عن النقد، فإذا تجسّدت الديمقراطية في المساواة وتكافؤ المراتب والفرص، فما الذي يضمن إن لم تُدعَّم بشرط الحرية أنها لن تستحيل طغيانًا؟ كان توكفيل يؤمن بأن امتداح الفضائل لا يصون الشرائع من نزوع إلى طغيان يُزيَّن بلبوس الاستقامة. وقد بيّن هذا المعنى في قوله: "ويخطئ كثيرًا من يحسب أن غرضي من الكتاب هو امتداح أميركا، فمن قرأ الكتاب أدرك أن المديح ليس من بين أغراضه".							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287002
287001	2	الخليج العربي : | دراسة لتاريخ الإمارات العربية (1840-1914) /	قاسم، جمال زكريا،	يشكل الخليج العربي الحد الشرقي الأقصى للوطن العربي الكبير، بعد أن تراجع المد العربي عن أقاليم فارس وما يليها شرقاً تاركاً بقاياه ماثلة في إقليم "عربستان" من أعمال جنوبي فارس، قبل أن تلتهمه القومية الإيرانية الحديثة. وهكذا كان تاريخ الإمارات العربية بين عامي 1840 - 1914 الذي يقدمه اليوم الدكتور جمال زكريا قاسم في هذا الكتاب الجاد الممتع ليس إلا تاريخ سعي السياسة البريطانية الدائب لتبسط سيطرتها على هذه الإمارات، بأن تعمل على إبقائها جميعاً مفككة عاجزة تنشد الأمان في ظل الأسطول البريطاني، وأن تعمل - في الوقت نفسه نفسه - على ! استبعاد أي قوة خارجية منافسة، حتى فازت بتوطيد (الوجود البريطاني في الخليج، ثم جاء تفجر البترول فأضاف إلى أهمية المواصلات العالمية أهمية جديدة مما زاد بريطانيا تشبثاً بوجودها على رمال الخليج وشطآنه. ¦ نتناول في هذا الكتاب تاريخ الإمارات العربية في الخليج العربي منذ انسحاب القوات المصرية من الخليج وشبة الجزيرة العربية 1840 إلى نشوب الحرب العالية الأولى عام 1914، وهذه الدراسة تشمل تقريبا النصف الثاني من القرن التاسع عشر وأوائل القرن العشرين، ولهذه الفترة أهميتها البالغة في تاريخ الخليج العربي وسياسته بوجه عام، وعلى الرغم من وجود صعوبات كثيرة قد يتعرض لها الباحث في دراسته لتاريخ عدة إمارات أو دول مختلفة إلا أننا نرى أن تناول تاريخ إمارات الخليج کوحدة واحدة يقوم على منهج سلیم، ذلك لأن القرنين الأخيرين من تارخ الخليج العربي كانا يدوران حول محور السياسة البريطانية التي كانت تهدف في الدرجة الأولى إلى المحافظة على استتباب الأمن في الخليج باعتباره من أهم الطرق الحيوية الموصلة إلى إمبراطوريتها في الشرف وهذا لا يتأتى إلا باستئثارها بالنفوذ فيه ومنع أي دولة أخرى من الوصول إليه، ولهذا قضت بريطانيا القرين الثامن عشر والتاسع عشر في العمل على القضاء على القرصنة وتجارة الرقيق وفي عمليات المسح والحراسة، وهذه هي حجتها كلما دخلت هذه البلد.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=287001
286964	2	صعود الصين في منطقة الخليج /	أبودوح، أحمد	يمرّ نفوذ الصين بمسار صعودي في منطقة الخليج منذ تولي الرئيس شي جينبينغ الحكمَ عام 2012/2013، وتزامن هذا الصعود مع تحولات جيوسياسية إقليمية شكّلت فرصاً لتوسيع النفوذَين الاقتصادي والسياسي الصيني في المنطقة. وأحد أهم هذه التحولات هو التغير في التصورات الاستراتيجية لدول الخليج إزاء الولايات المتحدة وموقعها كمزوّد للأمن في الخليج ومستقبله.         ومنذ عقد القمم الثلاث (الصينية-السعودية، والصينية-الخليجية، والصينية-العربية) خلال زيارة الرئيس الصيني للرياض في ديسمبر 2022، وما تلاها من وساطة بيجين في توقيع اتفاق استئناف العلاقات الدبلوماسية بين السعودية وإيران، زادت التوقعات بشأن توسع رؤية الصين لدورها في منطقة الخليج ومنطقة الشرق الأوسط الأوسع، سواء اقتصرت طبيعة هذا الدور على الوساطات الدبلوماسية أو امتدت إلى أداء دور أمني أيضاً.         لا شك في أن اهتمام الصين بالمنطقة سيخلق فرصاً وتحديات لدولها، وتفاعلات مستقبلية لا يمكن للدارسين للمنطقة ولتأثير تنافس القوى العظمى فيها تجاهلها. لذلك، أَوْلى مركز الإمارات للسياسات اهتماماً خاصاً بدراسة هذه التفاعلات في ضوء فهم أولويات القيادة الصينية في المنطقة، والتداعيات المحتملة على مصالح دولها الاستراتيجية، وتفضيلات الولايات المتحدة، ومآلات ذلك. ويقدم المركز هذا الإصدار البحثي لصانعي السياسات والباحثين والمهتمين سعياً لإثراء النقاش حول هذا الموضوع المهم والمؤثّر في مستقبل المنطقة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286964
286963	2	المسألة الدستورية و تدبير الاختلاف بين الشريعة والقانون /	غوتي، محمد الاغضف،	إن الخلاف في شأن موضوع “تدبير الاختلاف بين الفقه والتشريع المعاصر في المجال الدستوري” ليس أمرًا جديدًا ولا مرتبطًا بهذه المرحلة التاريخية دون غيرها، بل يجد أثره في التراث الإسلامي منذ فجر الإسلام، إذ ثار دائمًا خلاف حول نموذجين سياسيين متنازعين: نموذج يؤسس السلطة والممارسة السياسية على قيم ومبادئ إنسانية لكي تصير سياسة مقبولة وشرعية؛ ونموذج آخر يرفع شعار البراغماتية، ويجعل من السلطة والسياسة هدفًا ومن القيم والمبادئ وسيلة. فهل هذا الاختلاف هو اختلاف تنوّع أم اختلاف تضاد؟ وكيف يمكن تدبيره؟    يترتب على هذا الأمر أسئلة كثيرة سيحاول هذا الكتاب تقديم بعض عناصر الإجابة عنها: فما هي عناصر الاختلاف بين الفقه والتشريع الحديث؟ وهل من سبيل إلى حل هذا “الاشتباك التاريخي” بين الفقه والنصوص الوضعية؟ وما هي الرؤية القادرة على تدبير الخلاف بين الفقه والتشريع المعاصر في المجال الدستوري؟ وكيف ممكن تدبير الاختلاف بين الدولة الدينية والدولة المدنية؟ وما هي طبيعة الدولة المدنية التي مرجعها الإسلام؟ وماذا عن مكانة الحريات العامة وحقوق الإنسان في هذه الدولة؟ …    يتناول هذا الكتاب واحدة من أكبر الإشكاليات التي تواجه العقل الإسلامي في العصر الحديث؛ وهي المواءمة بين نصوص الفقه ومقتضيات الواقع في التشريعات القانونية. وهو لا يزعم تقديم إجابات شافية عن هذه الأسئلة وغيرها، لكنه يسعى لتقديم إجابات غير تقليدية على الأقل يخلص المؤلف إليها من خلال اعتماد نسق منهجي تركيبي يأخذ في الحسبان تنوع مجال البحث وامتداده بين حقول معرفية متعددة، منها ما هو ديني شرعي ومنها ما هو قانوني وضعي وما هو حقوقي كوني.    يتضمن الكتاب أربعة فصول، فضلاً عن الفصل التمهيدي والخاتمة والملاحق والمراجع والفهرس.    يقع الكتاب في 432 صفحة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286963
286962	2	الأمن القومي العربي وتحديات الأمن الإقليمي /	أحمد، حسن الحاج علي	يحتوي الكتاب على إحدى عشرة دراسة تتمحور جميعها حول موضوع الأمن القومي العربي، لاثني عشر باحثًا وباحثة عربًا في اختصاصات العلوم السياسية والإدارية، الحضارة الإسلامية، العلاقات الدولية، الفكر السياسي الإسلامي، السياسة الخارجية الأميركية، الشؤون الخليجية الاستراتيجية، الشؤون العسكرية، أمن الخليج، الاقتصاد المعرفي في الخليج العربي، الدراسات المستقبلية الاستراتيجية، قضايا القومية العربية، وشؤون الجريمة السيبرانية. حرّر الكتاب مروان قبلان، وهو يقع في 432 صفحة، شاملةً ببليوغرافيا وفهرسًا عامًّا. ¦ يعالج مروان قبلان في الفصل الأول من كتاب الأمن القومي العربي وتحديات الأمن الإقليمي تحولات الأمن القومي العربي بوصفه أحد تجليات النهوض القومي العربي، مرورًا بمأسسته في صيغة عمل عربي موحَّد مع توقيع "معاهدة الدفاع المشترك ضد إسرائيل"، وصولًا إلى انحدار مفهوم الأمن القومي العربي مع صعود المصالح القُطرية وانقسام الرؤى حول الصراع مع إسرائيل والعلاقة مع إيران، ثم انهياره مع الغزو العراقي للكويت، وتراجع الحضور العربي في القضية الفلسطينية، والغزو الأميركي للعراق، وثورات الربيع العربي. ويرى قبلان وجوب تكثيف الجهود لبلورة رؤية جديدة للأمن القومي العربي، باعتباره ضرورة تاريخية يؤدي التخلي عنها إلى الإضرار بالأمن الوطني لكل دولة عربية. ¦ ويناقش محمد خميس في الفصل الثاني الأزمةَ البنيوية التي تعانيها جامعة الدول العربية في مأسسة الأمن القومي العربي، مُرجِعًا السبب إلى خيار المقاربة التوفيقية بين مطلب الهوية الجامعة والنزعة القُطرية للدول العربية بعد الاستعمار، التي ظهرت في البناء المؤسسي للجامعة وفي الأنماط السلوكية لكل دولة عربية. ويعرض الفصل للفكرة القومية كما نشأت في سياقاتها الأوروبية ولتجلياتها في السياق العربي، كما يتناول إشكالية مأسسة جامعة الدول العربية حول مفهوم القومية العربية، ويضع تجربة الجامعة تحت منظار نظريات العلاقات الدولية بوصفها أطرًا تساعد في إعادة طرح أسئلة حول التجربة العربية في الوحدة وبناء الهوية والمأسسة الدولية. ¦ في الفصل الثالث، يركز سيد أحمد قوجيلي على تفسير التعارض النظري بين نظرية تكميل كل من الأمن القومي والأمن المجتمعي والأمن الإنساني نظيرَيه وبين الواقع العربي، ويقترح إطارًا نظريًّا يدعوه "الكفاءة الأمنية" لإنجاز المستوى الأعلى الممكن من الأمن بالمقدار الأقل من التكاليف، ويرى أنّها كفاءة تؤمَّن بضمان فاعلية الأجهزة الأمنية العربية في حماية النظام أولًا، وضمان قدرة الأخير على حماية "التحالف" الذي يدعمه ثانيًا، وضمان حماية "المصالح" لكل من هذه الأطراف، ثالثًا. كما يقدم قوجيلي أدلة من بلدان عربية أفادت بأنّ أمن الدولة العربية ليس بالضرورة امتدادًا لأمن مواطنيها، كما أنّ أمن المواطنين ليس امتدادًا لأمنها. ¦ ويحاول كاظم هاشم نعمة في الفصل الرابع إثبات أن التطورات الدولية والإقليمية في الشرق الأوسط بعد الحرب الباردة، كالثورة الإيرانية والحرب العراقية - الإيرانية وحرب الخليج الثانية (1990-1991) ساهمت في بروز نزعة نحو الأمن الإقليمي الفرعي شكلت تحديات جليّة وأدت إلى تأسيس مجلس التعاون (1981) واتحاد المغرب العربي (1989)، موضحًا أن هذه المجالس، وبصرف النظر عما ورد في ديباجاتها من دعوات إلى الوحدة والتكامل والأمن الجماعي، جزّأت الأمن القومي العربي، وغيّرت مصدر التهديد وبؤرته وأولويته، وحوّلته من القومية إلى القُطرية وشبه الإقليمية، ما رتّب عجزًا في تطوير استراتيجية لصدّ التهديدات الأمنية التي تشمل البلدان العربية. ¦ أما عبد الله الغيلاني، فيقسّم في الفصل الخامس المخاطر الأمنية التي تواجهها دول الخليج العربية وفقًا لمستويين: أولهما الانكشاف الأمني واحتمالات تهديده استقرار منطقة الخليج وجوارها، وثانيهما التحديات الجيوسياسية المشتركة للدول الخليجية خلال انتقالها من دولة الرفاه الريعية إلى دولة الحداثة، الذي يرتب استحقاقات سياسية وتحولات في أنماط التفكير السياسي وإدارة المجتمع، وهي برأيه تحديات أكبر وأبعد أثرًا من المخاطر الأمنية التي ظلت دول الخليج العربية تواجهها على الدوام منذ نشوئها، وكذلك المخاطر السياسية التي لطالما مثّلت تحدّيًا للأنظمة القائمة. ويشدد الغيلاني على أنه ما لم يحصل تطور نوعي في أنماط التفكير الاستراتيجي الرسمي، فإن المنطقة ستتّجه إلى مزيد من التصدع الداخلي والوهن الأمني، وأن هذه المعضلة إذا استحكمت حلقاتها فستفضي قطعًا إلى انهيارات كبرى. ¦ يتناول محمد صالح المسفر في الفصل السادس مدى تأثير التهديدات التي تواجه مجلس التعاون في المستقبل. وإثر استعراضه موقع الخليج وأهميته التاريخية والمعاصرة، يرى المسفر أن أهميته ازدادت أضعافًا مضاعفة إثر اكتشافات النفط فيه. ويعالج الفصل التحديات الدولية والإقليمية والداخلية التي لمّا تزل دول مجلس التعاون تواجهها منذ تأسيسه، كما يتناول التهديدات الاقتصادية، ويرى أنه من غير الدقيق القول إن التكامل الاقتصادي بين دول مجلس التعاون قد أُنجز بالفعل، حتى في حده الأدنى، على الرغم من كل المشاريع المنفّذة والتي في طور التنفيذ بين دول المنظومة الخليجية. ويطرح الفصل أخيرًا سؤالًا عن كيفية مواجهة تهديدات اختلال التركيبة السكانية. ¦ ويبحث علي الذهب في الفصل السابع تداعيات التدخل الإقليمي في حرب اليمن الدائرة منذ عام 2015 بين التحالف العربي بقيادة المملكة العربية السعودية والإمارات بصفته مستدعى من الحكومة اليمنية الشرعية المعترف بها دوليًّا، وبين إيران بوصفها الداعم الأبرز لميلشيات أنصار الله (الحوثيين) الذين سيطروا على السلطة بانقلاب مسلّح عام 2014 .ويركز الفصل على مناقشة دور اليمن في تعزيز أمن الإقليم ومكافحة التحديات التي تواجهه داخليًّا وخارجيًّا. كما يناقش أبعاد تدخّل الأطراف الإقليمية فيه ودوافعه، والأوزان الاستراتيجية لهذه الأطراف على الأرض، وحجم قواتها وطبيعته ومناطق تموضعها. ويخلص إلى أنّ الهدف الحقيقي من التدخلات الإقليمية في اليمن منذ عام 2015 ليس دعم الحكومة الشرعية بل الأطماع الجيوسياسية لهذه الأطراف في الإطلالة على البحر الأحمر وخليج عدن وبحر العرب. والاتجاه إلى تقسيم اليمن بين شمالٍ وجنوب تمهيدًا لتقسيم دول الجزيرة والخليج العربي على أسس طائفية وجغرافية. ¦ أمّا حسن الحاج علي أحمد، فيناقش في الفصل الثامن التنافس الإقليمي في منطقة القرن الأفريقي ووادي النيل وتكريسه تهديدات أمنية تواجه المنطقة. ويطرح فرضية وجود عاملَين يحركان هذا التنافس الدولي والإقليمي: أوّلهما هشاشة حكومات المنطقة وضعفها، وثانيهما تأثير الأبعاد الجيوسياسية والأمنية فيها. ويحاجّ علي أحمد بأنّ التنافس الجديد على منطقة القرن الأفريقي يختلف عنه في أواخر القرن التاسع عشر في الطمع بالمياه والأرض والغذاء والسيطرة على الموانئ وطرق النقل، ويستعرض تطوّر السياسة الأمنية الأميركية لتحقيق ذلك، وتأثير الوجود العسكري الأوروبي في المنطقة، وآثار التمدد العسكري والتجاري الصيني، وأخيرًا تنافس تركيا والهند وروسيا وبعض دول الخليج في منطقة القرن الأفريقي والبحر الأحمر. ¦ أمّا خليفة حداد، فيسلط في الفصل التاسع الضوء على التحديات الأمنية في ليبيا منذ ظهور الدولة الوطنية، ويحاجّ بأنه في الحقبتين الملكية والجماهيرية ظلّ دور القبيلة والعشيرة والطائفة، وهي المرجعيات التقليدية، في مصلحة النظام الحاكم مع ما بينها من تناقضات، ظلت كامنةً بفعل السطوة الأمنية للنظام وانتشار ثقافة الغنيمة، وطفت بقوة عند تهاوي النظام الليبي في عام 2011 وظهرت معها التشظيات المتعددة المسارات التي ضربت الهيئة الاجتماعية وفككتها، وحوّلت الجغرافيا الليبية إلى ميدان تقاتل. ويرى حداد أنّ استجابة دول الجوار المغاربي ظلت دون مستوى المخاطر المحدقة بليبيا؛ إذ غيَّبت الخلافات البينية وسياسة الانكفاء والحذر أيَّ مشروع إقليمي جامع لمجابهة ارتدادات الزلزال الليبي والمشاريعِ الإقليمية الهادفة إلى توجيه مخرجات الربيع العربي إلى مسارات الفوضى والحروب الأهلية وخلخلة ما بقي من مقومات الأمن القومي العربي. ¦ وتبيِّن العنود آل خليفة في الفصل العاشر أنّ أمن الطاقة بات من التحديات الكبرى التي تواجه دول الخليج العربية، وبخاصة مع بروز مشاريع توليد الطاقة النووية في المنطقة. وتطرح للنقاش مسائل الحاجة الاستراتيجية لدول مجلس التعاون إلى تطوير برامج للطاقة النووية السلمية، ومدى تأثير برنامج إيران النووي وتهديداته في السياسة الخليجية النووية السلمية، وإجراءات الأمان النووي التي على دول مجلس التعاون تطبيقها من أجل برنامج نووي سلمي. وتشكّل هذه المسائل معًا السؤال الشامل: هل ستعزز برامج الطاقة النووية السلمية أمن الطاقة في دول مجلس التعاون؟ وتوزّعت الإجابة على أربعة محاور: مفهوم أمن الطاقة، وأمن الطاقة من منظور دول مجلس التعاون، وموقف دول المجلس من المشاريع النووية السلمية، ومخاطر هذه المشاريع. ¦ أمّا منى الأشقر جبور ومحمود عارف جبور، فيبحثان في الفصل الحادي عشر ظهورَ أسلحة جديدة غيّرت الشكل التقليدي للصراعات بين الدول وأدخلت إليها لاعبين جددًا، أفرادًا ومنظماتٍ ومجموعاتٍ، بعد أن كانت مقتصرة على الدول، كما جعلت مرافق الدولة الحساسة عرضةً للمخاطر الأمنية، ما فرض أنواعًا جديدة من التحديات، كالحرب السيبرانية، والإرهاب السيبراني، والتجسس السيبراني، التي تشكل مخاطر ليس العالم العربي بمنأى عنها، إن لم يكن في قلبها، بفعل تطور استعمال تقنيات المعلومات والاتصالات. ويتطرق الباحثان إلى انعكاسات ما تقدَّم على الأمن الوطني والقومي العربي، وإلى الخطوات الضرورية للتصدي، عبر رسم استراتيجيات موحدة وسياسات واضحة على المستويَين الوطني والإقليمي، ووضع أطر لتعاونٍ وثيق وتنسيقٍ دائم وإنشاء هيئات متخصصة تتلاءم وطبيعة التحديات الأمنية الجديدة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286962
286961	2	جيوبوليتيك حوض المتوسط : | ترسيم الحدود البحرية وقضايا السلام والأمن الدوليين /		يحتل حوض البحر الأبيض المتوسط موقعًا استراتيجيًا استثنائيًا على الصعيد العالمي؛ فهو يمثل نقطة التقاء بري وبحري للقارات الثلاث آسيا وأفريقيا أوروبا، ونقطة تواصل بين شرق الكرة الأرضية وغربها عبر الوصل بين المحيطين الأطلسي والهندي، وهو يشاطئ نحو 24 دولة وكيانًا سياسيًا وبشريًا، وحضاريًا، ويختضن على شواطئه الشرقية والجنوبية معًا تجمعات بشرية ودولًا تكتنز أهم الثروات المعدنية والبحرية، وموارد الطاقة التي لا تزال تمثّل أهم العناصر في قلب علاقات دول الضفتين، الجنوبية والشرقية للحوض المتوسطي، بأوروبا. كما يؤدي هذا الحوض المائي المتوسطي دوراً أساسياً في التّجارة الدولية وتعزيز ممارّ الطّرق البحرية. وقد ازدادت حدّة التّنافس الدولي حول هذا الفضاء، مع اندلاع ما يعرف بـ”الربيع العربي” منذ عام 2011 ، إذ حاولت القوى العالمية الكبرى والقوى الإقليمية استغلال الفراغ الاستراتيجي الحاصل في المنطقة العربية المتوسطية بهدف تعزيز نفوذها العسكري والتجاري حول الموارد الاستراتيجية لهذه المنطقة.    يثير هذا الكتاب الاهتمام بتجدّد الأهمية الاستراتيجية لحوض البحر الأبيض المتوسط كبحر حاضن للعنف والتفاعل والصراع والسلم والانفتاح على العالم الخارجي، في ظل توجُّه الكثير من الدول المشاطئة لهذا الحوض إلى ترسيم حدودها البحرية، وبخاصة بعد اتساع دائرة الاكتشافات النفطية والغازيّة فيه. وفي ظل هذه المتناقضات، يقف صانع السياسات العامة في البلدان العربية أمام مخاطر التنافس على حوض البحر الأبيض المتوسط الذي يمثّل جزءًا من التنافس الدولي على الموارد البحرية والممارّ المائية والسيطرة عليها. لذا يبدو تعزيز السلم والأمن في حوض البحر الأبيض المتوسط بعيد المنال، نظرًا إلى طُول مخالب القوى الكبرى التي تتربص بالعالم العربي.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286961
286956	2	استراتيجية الغاز الأميركية-الإسرائيلية في شرق البحر المتوسط /	عويضة، شادي سمير	يندرج كتاب استراتيجية الغاز الأميركية - الإسرائيلية في شرق البحر المتوسط ضمن سلسلة "أطروحات الدكتوراه" التي تبناها المركز العربي للأبحاث ودراسة السياسات، وهي تلتزم نشر ما هو نوعي وأفضل وأكفأ في مجالات حقول العلوم الإنسانية والاجتماعية العربية، سواء قُدِّمت الأطروحة في الجامعات العربية أو الأجنبية، وذلك في حال توافقها مع اهتمامات المركز، وانطلاقًا من أهدافه الأساسية المتركزة حول استئناف النهضة الفكرية والعلمية العربية، ومعالجة قضايا الوطن العربي ومجتمعاته.    يشتمل الكتاب على خمسة فصول تتمحور مواضيعها حول علاقة اكتشاف الغاز في منطقة شرق البحر المتوسط بالاستراتيجية الأميركية - الإسرائيلية في الشرق الأوسط وتأثيره فيها، وهو من تأليف شادي سمير عويضة، ويقع في 327 صفحة، شاملةً ببليوغرافيا وفهرسًا عامًّا. ¦ يبحث الفصل الأول "استراتيجية العلاقات الأميركية الإسرائيلية في الشرق الأوسط" مفهوم "الاستراتيجية الأميركية" التي تُعتبر في نظر المؤلف من أكثر المصطلحات تداولًا لدى المتخصصين والباحثين ومراكز البحوث وصناع القرار والمؤسسات المتخصصة - العربية منها والأجنبية – إذ إنّ لها تأثيرًا في صنّاع القرار على المستويات المحلية والإقليمية والعالمية كافة، وتأثيرًا واضحًا في القضايا السياسة الدولية. ويرى الخبراء الاستراتيجيون أنه ما من بقعة في العالم لا تتأثر بالاستراتيجية الأميركية، إنْ إيجابيًّا أو سلبيًّا؛ وذلك بسبب معالجة الولايات المتحدة القضايا الكونية استراتيجيًّا وسياسيًّا واقتصاديًّا وعسكريًّا وثقافيًّا واجتماعيًّا بوسائل وأهداف بعيدة ومتوسطة وقريبة الأمد؛ منها ما يمثل تحقيقه استراتيجية كبرى وملحّة ومصيرية لصانع القرار الأميركي، مثل تحقيق الأمن القومي، والتفوق الاستراتيجي، والحفاظ على السيطرة والتربع على قمة الهرم الدولي في نظام دولي أحادي القطبية، ومنها ما يتعلق بالمصالح الاستراتيجية الاقتصادية - السياسية في الشرق الأوسط، ويتعلق بحماية مصادر الطاقة من النفط والغاز والحفاظ على أمن إسرائيل وحماية نفوذها في المنطقة. ¦ أما الفصل الثاني، وهو بعنوان "إمكانات الغاز الطبيعي في شرق البحر المتوسط"، فيبيّن الأهمية الكبرى لاكتشاف احتياطي الغاز الضخم في حوض المتوسط على الصُّعد الجيوسياسية والجيو - اقتصادية والجيو - استراتيجية كافة، ولازدياد هذه الأهمية كثيرًا مع ارتفاع نسَب الطلب الدولي على الغاز من القوى الدولية الكبرى، ثمّ إنّ هذه الاكتشافات ستشكّل تحولًا جذريًّا في استراتيجيات الدول الكبرى، مثل الولايات المتحدة وروسيا، تجاه دول المنطقة؛ فمن شأن استخراج كميات كبيرة من الغاز في منطقة حوض المتوسط أن يوفر فرصًا لتعاون إقليمي بين دولها المتجاورة، مثل إسرائيل ولبنان وتركيا وقبرص واليونان ومصر، في ظل حاجتها لضمان توفير أمن ثرواتها. ويفيد اكتشاف الغاز في شرق المتوسط الاستراتيجية الأميركية - الإسرائيلية في ترتيب أولويات البلدين في المنطقة؛ إذ تسعى إسرائيل جاهدةً إلى مشاركة الدول المجاورة، وخصوصًا قبرص، في تصدير الغاز من خلال أنابيب إلى أوروبا عبر قبرص واليونان وإيطاليا. ويعتبر المؤلف أن اكتشافات الغاز الجديدة ستؤثر في التوجه الجيوسياسي المستقبلي لشرق المتوسط، بتطوير استراتيجيات المنافسين الدوليين، للوصول إلى الموارد الطبيعية النفطية والغازية والسيطرة عليها. ¦ يَرِد الفصل الثالث بعنوان "الاستراتيجية الأميركية الإسرائيلية في ظل اكتشاف الغاز في شرق البحر المتوسط"، وهو يكرس نظرية ازدياد إمكانية التعاون بين دول منطقة حوض المتوسط في إثر الاكتشافات الكبيرة للغاز الطبيعي، مع احتمال زيادة حدة التنافس بينها بعد توقيع العقود مع الدول الأخرى، ويؤكد هذا الفصل أن الاكتشافات الجديدة ستحوّل حوض المتوسط منطقةَ استقطاب للدول الكبرى للسيطرة على احتياطيات الغاز الطبيعي والنفط والاستحواذ عليها، وخصوصًا الولايات المتحدة وروسيا، اللتين تتنافسان على خلق تحالفات سياسية جديدة عنوانها "المصالح الاقتصادية والتجارية المشتركة".    ويذهب المؤلف إلى أن السياسة الاستراتيجية لغالبية الرؤساء الأميركيين، ديمقراطيين أو جمهوريين، واحدة تجاه الشرق الأوسط، وبخاصة ما يتعلق منها بالسيطرة على موارده وثرواته، وأن هذه الاستراتيجية حاضرة بقوة من خلال دعم الولايات المتحدة إسرائيل؛ إذ تعتبرها الحليف الأساسي والأبرز في المنطقة، وما يتعلق أيضًا بتعزيز تفوقها ونفوذها الإقليمي لتكون إسرائيل الركيزة والقوة الاقتصادية الأبرز في المنطقة، من خلال سيطرتها على أكبر قدر ممكن من مصادر الغاز في المنطقة وامتلاكها. ¦ ينحو الفصل الرابع "التعاون الأميركي - الإسرائيلي الاستراتيجي تجاه دول غاز البحر المتوسط" إلى أن تحوّل منطقة حوض المتوسط مستودعًا دوليًّا عملاقًا للطاقة سوف يؤدي إلى التنافس الدولي الشديد عليه، وأن إسرائيل هي الأكثر انخراطًا في الصراعات مع دول الجوار: فلسطين ولبنان وتركيا ومصر واليونان وقبرص، مباشرة أو على نحو غير مباشر؛ لا سيما بعد ثورات "الربيع العربي"، ووقف إمدادات الغاز المصري المهمة إليها. وأكثر ما يتمثل اهتمامُ إسرائيل بمسألة الغاز في حجم الاستثمارات والشركات الإسرائيلية العاملة بالتنقيب في شرق المتوسط، إلى درجة التبادل التكنولوجي مع الشركات الأميركية الكبرى، ووضعها استراتيجية خاصة بها لتحقيق الاكتفاء الذاتي من الغاز الطبيعي، بل تحولها دولةً مصدرة له أيضًا. ونظرًا إلى وجود الولايات المتحدة فاعلًا مركزيًّا في الصراع على الغاز، فقد دخلت لعبة الصراع على النفوذ والسيطرة في شرق المتوسط إلى جانب إيطاليا وروسيا وفرنسا وبريطانيا، مع سعيها إلى التعاون بين شركات النفط العاملة في المنطقة على أسس اقتصادية، بعيدًا من الصراعات الجيوسياسية، ولذلك سعت إلى فرض الاستقرار على الحوض استنادًا إلى تحالفَي الولايات المتحدة - تركيا - إسرائيل والولايات المتحدة - مصر - إسرائيل، لخلق حالة تؤمّن المصالح الاقتصادية لإسرائيل وباقي دول المنطقة، عبر تحالفات تجارية قد تتحول مستقبلًا إلى اتفاقات سياسية ترتّب الخرائط الجيوسياسية والجغرافية والاقتصادية للمنطقة، وتنشئ ممرات آمنة لخطوط الطاقة. ¦ اعتبر الفصل الخامس (الأخير)، "مستقبل الاستراتيجية الأميركية الإسرائيلية في ظل اكتشافات الغاز في شرق البحر المتوسط"، أنّ اكتشاف الغاز في حوض المتوسط شجّع كثيرًا من الدول على توسيع نفوذها في المنطقة، وأنّ "ملف الغاز" لم يعد شأنًا داخليًّا للدول أو لخفض فاتورة الاستيراد فحسب، بل بات شأنًا إقليميًّا للإمساك بأوراق تفاوضية وسط ارتباك وانقسام دوليين، وموضوعًا ذا أولوية قصوى في ما وراء الإقليم، وأحد مفاتيح تفسير كثير من التطورات والتحالفات والصراعات السياسية والعسكرية الدائرة في ساحات دول عدة في الشرق الأوسط أيضًا. وإذ تشكّل موارد غاز شرق البحر المتوسط، مزيجًا ثريًا للمصالح الأمنية والتجارية والدبلوماسية للدول، فإن تنوّع المصالح وتشابكها وتداخلها يمكن أن يساهم كلّه في احتدام الصراع الذي كاد يصل في وقت من الأوقات إلى حافة الصدام العسكري بين المتنافسين. وقد كشف احتدام التنافس مدى ارتباط هذا الملف بمسائل أعمق؛ فالسيطرة على الغاز تمس العلاقة بين أوروبا وروسيا، ومدى اعتماد الأولى على غاز الثانية، وهذا الأمر يخص العلاقة داخل الاتحاد الأوروبي نفسه، بسبب اتخاذ الدول مواقف مختلفة من تركيا؛ بين مقاربة تفاوضية من ألمانيا، وصدامية من فرنسا.    لقد عالج المؤلف موضوعًا مهمًّا ومبهمًا في حقل السياسة الدولية يخص البعد الاستراتيجي لظهور الغاز الطبيعي في منطقة شرق البحر المتوسط، وأثره في إعادة تشكيل التحالفات الإقليمية والدولية، وهو بهذا قدّم منظورًا استراتيجيًا لصناع القرار الإقليمي والدولي والمهتمين بمجال الدراسات الدولية.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286956
286955	2	خطوط الغاز الروسية : | الأبعاد الجيوسياسية والاقتصادية /	شلش، مصطفى	أثار صعود روسيا كقوة للطاقة جدلاً عبر جانبي الأطلسي، وانتقدت الولايات المتحدة كثيرًا حلفاءها الأوروبيين الغربيين لسعيهم إلى تعزيز علاقات الطاقة مع موسكو، وادعت أن تدفق العملات الأجنبية الناتج من مبيعات الطاقة سيساعد الكرملين على تحديث الجيش. كان الجدل الكبير يتعلق دائمًا بجهود إيصال إمدادات الغاز عبر خطوط الأنابيب. وخشيت واشنطن أن يؤدي الاعتماد الأوروبي المتزايد على إمدادات الغاز الروسي إلى إضعاف العزيمة السياسية لأوروبا.    يعيش العالم اليوم اضطرابات في شأن تأمين إمدادات الطاقة. وعلى الرغم من انخفاض الطلب العالمي على النفط والغاز من جرّاء الإغلاق الذي فرضته جائحة كورونا، فإن المعروض في سوق الطاقة قليل، والأسعار مُرتفعة بوجه عام. هذا إلى جانب العقوبات الأمريكية والأوروبية التي استهدفت روسيا عقب إعلان الأخيرة عن عملية عسكرية ضد أوكرانيا مطلع عام 2022، وهو ما حجب إمدادات الطاقة الروسية عن السوق العالمية. أحدثت هذه التطورات تغيرات كبيرة في خريطة الطاقة العالمية، إذ يستورد الاتحاد الأوروبي ما يقرب من ثلث نفطه وما يقرب من نصف غازه الطبيعي من روسيا. ويختلف مستوى الاعتمادية على هذه الإمدادات من الطاقة الروسية بين البلدان الأعضاء في الاتحاد الأوروبي، في حين يعتمد بعض جيران روسيا ما بعد الاتحاد السوفياتي، وكذلك البلدان غير الأعضاء في الاتحاد الأوروبي في غرب البلقان وتركيا بصفة أساسية، على الطاقة الروسية.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286955
286954	2	العرب والهند : | تحولات العلاقة مع قوة ناشئة ومستقبلها /	يوسف، أيمن	يضم الكتاب ثلاثة عشر بحثًا قدّمت في مؤتمر تحت العنوان نفسه، عقده المركز بمقرّه في الدوحة في أيار/ مايو 2018. تنطلق هذه البحوث من اعتبار أنّ الصورة التي ترسم مستقبل الهند بصفتها قوّة عالمية صاعدة من الشرق، إضافة إلى قربها الجغرافي من البرّ العربي، وروابطها التاريخية والثقافية بشعوبه، ووجود كتلة كبيرة من العمالة الهندية في دول الخليج العربية، تفرض اهتمام العرب المتزايد بها. كما أن الهند من أكبر مستوردي الطاقة العربية، وبات نموها الاقتصادي ومكانتها العالمية مرتبطين بتوافر مصادر طاقة آمنة ومستمرة ورخيصة؛ ما يجعل علاقتها بالعالم العربي تكتسي أهمية استثنائية.  يتألف الكتاب (472 صفحة بالقطع الوسط، موثقًا ومفهرسًا) من 13 فصلًا، توزعت في ثلاثة أقسام.   ¦ العرب والهند بين الماضي والحاضر  يضم القسم الأول، "العرب والهند بين الماضي والحاضر"، 5 فصول. يعالج شمس الدين الكيلاني في الفصل الأول، "المتخيّل العربي عن الهند في برها وبحرها"، نظرة العرب إلى الهند في العصر الوسيط، لفهم ما قدمه العرب من أفكار وأحكام وتخيّلات ومواقف عن الهند، وتوصيف مظاهر تقدمها الثقافي، في برها وبحرها، وذلك في مبحثين، يتعلق أولهما بمُتخيَّل العرب عن الهند بما تمتلك من مظاهر العمران، وتزخر به من غنى ورقِيّ في مجالات شتى، ويتعلق ثانيهما بالتعرف إلى بحر الهند في شواطئه الزاخرة بالعمران، وتخومه البعيدة في أقصى الجنوب بما تعج به من عجائب وغرائب وتصورات أسطورية.    ويدرس صاحب عالم الأعظمي الندوي، في الفصل الثاني، "العلاقات بين الهند والجزيرة العربية في عصر الدولة المغولية"، التجارةَ المتبادلة بين شبه القارة الهندية والجزيرة العربية، والتي ساهمت في تقوية علاقات الهند التجارية والدينية والثقافية بالجزيرة العربية في عصر الدولتين الأموية والعباسية. ويهدف إلى قراءة طبيعة هذه العلاقات المتنوعة بين الهند والجزيرة العربية ودول الخليج في عصر الدولة المغولية لمعرفة إسهام السلاطين المغول في تطوير تلك العلاقات.    وتبحث بهية بنت سعيد بن جمعة العذوبية، في الفصل الثالث، "العلاقات العسكرية العُمانية - الهندية في الفترة 1913-1970: دراسة في الوثائق"، وجودَ القوات الهندية في عُمان في فترة حكم السلطان تيمور بن فيصل، وما ترتب عليها بعد ذلك من اهتمام بتشكيل الجيش العُماني والتأثيرات الهندية في اللغة والأزياء العسكرية. كما تتناول فترة الوجود البريطاني في الهند، وارتباط سلاطين عُمان باتفاقيات صداقة مع الحكومة البريطانية، وأثر ذلك في ظهور ارتباطات وعلاقات عسكرية مشتركة ومتبادلة بين الهند وعُمان.    بحوث وترجمات وعلاقات ثقافية  يناقش جافيد أحمد خان وديبا كروبان في الفصل الرابع، "البحوث المعاصرة في العلاقات العربية - الهندية بالجامعات الهندية: دراسة تقييمية"، مقاربات الأكاديميين والباحثين الهنود للعلاقات العربية - الهندية الناشئة في العقود الأخيرة، لرصد وتحليل وتقييم الموضوعات والمسائل المهملة في البحوث المعاصرة في العلاقات العربية - الهندية. ويهدف الباحثان إلى قراءة موضوعات ومضامين البحوث المنجزة عن العلاقات بين الهند وغرب آسيا التي أجرتها الجامعات الهندية في العقود الأربعة أو الخمسة الأخيرة، وخصوصًا عقب تدفّق عائدات النفط في منطقة الخليج، كما يهدفان إلى تقييم أهمية هذه الموضوعات والمسائل الناشئة المتصلة بالعلاقة بين الهند وغرب آسيا في العصر الحديث.    ويجادل محمد أفتاب أحمد، في الفصل الخامس، "دور الترجمة في تعزيز العلاقات العربية – الهندية"، بأنّ الترجمة ساهمت في نقل الإرث الهندي الثقافي والعلمي إلى لغات العالم المختلفة، ومن بينها العربية. ويهدف إلى تسليط الضوء على الأعمال المهمة التي جرى نقلها من اللغة الهندية إلى اللغة العربية، والعكس، خلال القرن الحادي والعشرين، والتي أدّت دورًا رئيسًا في التبادل الفكري بين الطرفين. ¦ الحضور الهندي في غرب آسيا  في القسم الثاني، "الحضور الهندي في غرب آسيا"، 3 فصول. يتناول عماد قدورة في الفصل السادس، "الأهمية الجيوبوليتيكية للخليج في استراتيجية الهند"، مكانةَ الخليج العربي الراهنة ودوره المتنامي في النظام الاقتصادي الدولي، ومكانة الخليج في استراتيجية الهند وسياستها الخارجية، وتأثير علاقات الفاعلين الإقليميين في تلك الاستراتيجية، مثل الصين وباكستان وإيران.    ويبحث عمير أنس، في الفصل السابع، "نهاية سياسة الهند المترددة تجاه غرب آسيا"، تحولات سياسة الهند تجاه غرب آسيا، للوقوف على التحديات التي تواجه السياسة الخارجية الهندية في غرب آسيا، والمتمثلة في السعي إلى تحقيق التوازن بين المملكة العربية السعودية وإيران من جهة، وإسرائيل وفلسطين من جهة أخرى، ودور القوى الدولية في المنطقة ونشوء التنافسات بين دول غرب آسيا لفرض نفوذها، ولا سيما في إثر الثورات العربية.    أما في الفصل الثامن، "إسرائيل وفلسطين: السياسة الخارجية الهندية إشكالية المبادئ وبراغماتية المصالح"، فيبحث أيمن يوسف ومحمود الفطافطة في تحولات السياسة الخارجية الهندية تجاه الصراع العربي – الإسرائيلي، وفي بواعث تحول السياسة الهندية مع التركيز على حاجة الهند الماسة إلى السلاح، وسعيها الاستراتيجي إلى تعزيز علاقتها بواشنطن، والخروج من أزمتها الاقتصادية، ومواجهة التحديات في منطقة جنوب آسيا، ومحاولتها الحصول على موقع متقدم في النظام الدولي الجديد. ¦ البعد الاقتصادي للعلاقات العربية – الهندية  في القسم الثالث، "البعد الاقتصادي للعلاقات العربية – الهندية"، 5 فصول. يدرس يوسف بن عبد الله الغيلاني وسعاد بنت عبد الله بيت فاضل، في الفصل التاسع، "العلاقات الاقتصادية بين عُمان والهند منذ منتصف القرن الثامن عشر حتى مطلع القرن العشرين"، طبيعةَ العلاقات الاقتصادية بين البلدين، والتغيرات التي طرأت عليها، والدور الذي أداه التجار الهنود لتحسين الاقتصاد العُماني، وإسهامهم في توسع تجارتَي الرقيق والسلاح منذ أن تولى أحمد بن سعيد الحكم إلى عهد السلطان فيصل بن تركي.    ويبيّن ناصر بن سيف السعدي، في الفصل العاشر، "الجالية الهندية في منطقة الخليج العربي قبل الطفرة النفطية: دراسة في جذور علاقة الهند بالخليج"، أن الهند كانت منذ القدم سوقًا ومصدرًا لسلع أهل الخليج وبضائعهم، وإليها تُصدّر منتوجات الخليج وبضائعه، وأن وجود الجالية الهندية في بلدان الخليج ليس أمرًا طارئًا ظهر مع ظهور النفط، إنما له امتداد بعيد في التاريخ، وكان الهنود أحد أهم مقومات الحياة الاقتصادية، بما قاموا به من أدوار في عملية التبادل التجاري وحركة السلع والبضائع في منطقة الخليج.    أما في الفصل الحادي عشر، "العلاقات العربية - الهندية: الطاقة وجوانب أخرى"، فيركز محمد أزهر على الجوانب المختلفة للعلاقات الاقتصادية العربية - الهندية، بما في ذلك تجارة الاستيراد والتصدير وميزان المدفوعات ومسألة القوى العاملة والتحويلات المالية، وكذلك ناقش حجم التعاون في قطاع الطاقة والقطاعات الأخرى.    في الطاقة والمحددات  في الفصل الثاني عشر، "العلاقات العربية - الهندية: نحو صيغة جديدة في مجال الطاقة المتجددة"، يتناول غيريجيش بانت التطور التاريخي لطبيعة العلاقات العربية ‑ الهندية، مع التركيز على اعتماد الهند على قطاع الطاقة. ويهدف إلى البحث في إمكانية تطوير واقع جديد لا يستند إلى القرب الجغرافي الاستراتيجي فحسب، بل إلى الاستثمار في التكنولوجيا المتجددة أيضًا.    أما الفصل الثالث عشر، والأخير، "العمالة الهندية في دول الخليج العربية: محدداتها الداخلية ودوافعها الخارجية"، ففيه تدرس سهام معط الله موضوع العمالة الهندية في دول الخليج، من ناحية أثر عدم المساواة في توزيع الدخل والبطالة في الهند في هجرة العمال الهنود نحو قطر والسعودية والإمارات العربية المتحدة والكويت والبحرين وعُمان. كما تدرس وتحلل أثر أسعار النفط في تدفّق العمالة الهندية المهاجرة إلى الخليج، وفي التحويلات المالية المرسلة من دول الخليج إلى الهند أيضًا في الفترة 1995-2016، باستخدام طريقة المربعات الصغرى، وأنموذج التأثيرات الثابتة، وطريقة العزوم المعممة الدينامية.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286954

286891	1	The formation of the UAE : | State-Building and Arab Nationalism in the Middle East /	Barnwell, Kristi.	December 2, 1971 ushered the United Arab Emirates into existence and marked the end of one hundred fifty years of British protection of the Arab states of the Gulf. Today, the UAE projects an image of modernity and prosperity; but before its formation, the emirates endured poverty and political upheaval while the rulers and people navigated the transition from autonomous city-states to modern nation states under informal British rule. This book shows how the Trucial States came to form a sovereign federation, paying particular attention to the role of nationalism and anti-imperialism. Kristi Barnwell demonstrates that the ruling sheikhs of the Gulf Arab rulers in the Gulf strove to create their new state with close ties to Great Britain, which provided technical, military and administrative assistance to the emirates, while also publicly embracing the popular ideologies of anti-imperialism and Arab socialism that were still dominating the political discourse in the Arab world. In the process, she situates the Emirates' modern history in the broader narratives of the history of the Middle East. The research draws on primary source materials from British and American government archives, speeches, and government publications from the Arab Emirates, as well as memoirs and secondary sources.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286891
286890	1	Energy Transitions in the Middle East : | Challenges and Opportunities /		How do Middle East energy transitions fit into international energy markets? In this book, energy analysts, geopolitical experts and specialists of political economy examine the new energy potential in the Middle East. The particular focus surrounds how the region's access to finance, combined with the new global regulations and considerations of economic development, shape the region's energy transitions overall. The Middle East is revealed to be a key site of new energy production, sharing and transmission as well as technology innovation. At the same time, the authors examine the variables that determine the success in each country and energy source, including the advantages that hydrocarbon producers will have in renewables and transition fuels, and the risk that these might slow down the energy transition overall. In doing so, the book situates the energy transition in the Middle East in a broader context of economic development, financing models, and regulations, and explains how this context interacts with the development of new energy sources. Energy Transitions in the Middle East is an account of the challenges Middle Eastern states will face in navigating the global energy transition, as well as their key areas of opportunity.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286890
286889	1	Nuclear war : | a scenario /	Jacobsen, Annie.	The INSTANT New York Times bestseller Instant Los Angeles Times bestseller "In Nuclear War: A Scenario, Annie Jacobsen gives us a vivid picture of what could happen if our nuclear guardians fail...Terrifying."--Wall Street Journal There is only one scenario other than an asteroid strike that could end the world as we know it in a matter of hours: nuclear war. And one of the triggers for that war would be a nuclear missile inbound toward the United States. Every generation, a journalist has looked deep into the heart of the nuclear military establishment: the technologies, the safeguards, the plans, and the risks. These investigations are vital to how we understand the world we really live in--where one nuclear missile will beget one in return, and where the choreography of the world's end requires massive decisions made on seconds' notice with information that is only as good as the intelligence we have. Pulitzer Prize finalist Annie Jacobsen's Nuclear War: A Scenario explores this ticking-clock scenario, based on dozens of exclusive new interviews with military and civilian experts who have built the weapons, have been privy to the response plans, and have been responsible for those decisions should they have needed to be made. Nuclear War: A Scenario examines the handful of minutes after a nuclear missile launch. It is essential reading, and unlike any other book in its depth and urgency.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286889
286888	1	Modern Populism : | Weaponizing for Power and Influence /	Tripathi, Deepak.	This book sheds light on modern populism and discusses the link between populism and identity politics against the backdrop of populist leaders asserting the identity of their own group, while maintaining the separation from others. Written by former BBC correspondent and commentator Deepak Tripathi, the book explains how populism has a long history with early discernable origins in the Tsarist Russian Empire and North America in the nineteenth century, spreading to Latin America, Europe, and elsewhere in the following century. The book analyzes various forms of populism, its causes and consequences. It further looks at how industrialization, economic growth, and movement of people led to conditions which contributed to inequalities, fueling populist sentiments and social conflict around the globe. Tripathi concludes that populism has moved from the fringes to the mainstream of politics, and is here to stay, given factors such as growing competition for resources, population increase, climate change, and migration. The book will appeal to students, scholars, and researchers of political science and neighboring disciplines, as well as policy-makers interested in a better understanding of modern populism and its roots. Written in a graceful, informative style, this book explores the rise of populism on the global scene and exposes its dangers.

286887	1	The art of military innovation : | lessons from the Israel Defense Forces /	Luttwak, Edward N.	Why is Israel's relatively small and low-budget military also the world's most innovative, technologically and logistically? Edward Luttwak and Eitan Shamir look to the IDF's unique structure: integrating army, air force, and navy in one service, under an officer class constantly refreshed by short tenures, the IDF is built for agility and change.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286887
286886	1	Weapons, technology and policy in the GCC States : | defending development /	Intelligence Unit, GEW.	This book aims to provide a comprehensive exploration of the strategic significance of the GCC states' defense industry, offering critical insights into its implications for regional security, economic development, and geopolitical dynamics. By examining the drivers and challenges surrounding the localization of the defense industry in these states, it seeks to unravel the complex processes and factors that shape this evolving sector. An in-depth analysis of the economic implications of localization constitutes another significant aspect of this book. As the defense industry becomes increasingly localized, it holds the potential to generate substantial economic growth, create high-skilled job opportunities, and foster technological innovation. Scrutinizing the economic dynamics and potential benefits of the defense industry in the GCC states offers valuable insights into their broader efforts towards economic diversification and reducing dependence on hydrocarbon revenues, ultimately facilitating the transition towards knowledge-based economies. Aside from economic considerations, this book also explores the security implications of local defense industry development. As the GCC states endeavor to achieve defense localization, there is potential for enhancing their military capabilities, reducing vulnerabilities, and strengthening their national security posture. Understanding the impact of these developments on regional security dynamics, military strategies, and collaborative defense initiatives is crucial for policymakers, security analysts, and defense officials.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286886
286885	1	Gulf ideological dynamics : | exploring the quest for unity and discord /		The Gulf ideological system is a set of interconnected beliefs and principles governing the region's political, economic, social, and cultural spheres. It combines various ideologies, including religious, nationalist, tribal, and pan-Islamic ideologies. It is shaped by a combination of historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors. Political alliances, economic shifts, social movements, and cultural exchanges contribute to its transformation. Economics plays a significant role in shaping Gulf ideologies. The region's wealth, derived from oil and gas reserves, has driven rapid economic development and created distinct economic ideologies within the Gulf. The social dimension of the Gulf ideological system is shaped by religion, culture, and societal norms. Islam influences various aspects of social life, contributing to conservative social ideologies in some Gulf countries. This book, "Gulf Ideological Dynamics", delves into the intricate web of political, economic, social, and cultural forces shaping the Gulf region. Authored by the GEW Reports & Analyses Team under the expert guidance of Dr. Hichem Karoui, this scholarly work offers a comprehensive examination of the complex dynamics driving unity and discord in the Gulf. From analyzing historical tensions to dissecting contemporary challenges, this book provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of Gulf ideologies. With meticulous research and astute observations, it sheds light on the interplay of various factors influencing regional dynamics. A vital contribution to the Sociology of the Gulf, this book offers a nuanced understanding of the ideological currents that shape this pivotal region.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286885

The threat from Salafi-jihadist groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State has declined, and ethnonationalist threats are largely contained. However, a broader patchwork of violent far-left extremist ideologies has become more prominent on the global stage.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286883
286882	1	Arab-Israel normalisation of ties : | global perspectives /		This book focuses on rapprochement and normalisation between Israel and some Arab countries within the context of global and regional geopolitics, bringing together broader perspectives on transformations resulting from this. The analysis is rooted in a historical and cultural construction of the region as an Islamic sphere viewing Israel as a perpetuation of the Western colonial project in the region. It analyses how this normalisation must not be treated as a novel phenomenon, but as a reconstruction of the past and continuity in tradition geared at regional stability, signifying a wider shift in the structure of the global international system. The first section addresses the international perspectives of the changing dynamics through the lens of US domestic politics, disengagement plans, China's increasing understanding of the geopolitics of the Abrahamic world. It equally pays enough attention to the attendant implications of this normalisation. The second section of the book explores the reflections of regional (state and non-state) actors, such as Turkey, Iran, Syria, Pakistan, and Hezbollah, and the catalysing effects of this normalisation within and beyond the region. The book is a rich resource for scholars of regional and international relations, in particular Middle East studies. It provides useful reading material for both undergraduate and graduate students of Political Science, think tanks, diplomats, and IR experts and policy analysts, who are desirous of having rich theoretical and empirical underpinnings of unfolding realities in the larger Middle East.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286882
286880	1	Power couple : | Russian-Iranian alignment in the Middle East /	Tazmini, Ghoncheh,	Cooperation between Iran and Russia has expanded to unprecedented levels. Following the Russian offensive in Ukraine, their partnership has undergone a significant transformation, altering power dynamics and elevating Iran from a junior partner to an equal counterpart. Russia's dependence on Iran in unexpected areas has caught observers by surprise. In her book, Ghoncheh Tazmini presents a fresh analysis of the complex relationship between Russia and Iran. She argues for a Russia-Iran 'alignment' based on their shared narratives of the international order. The two states are bound by connective tissue that is coded by ontological security preoccupations and mutual threat perceptions. Despite historical animosities and ongoing suspicions, the relationship has demonstrated resilience, fluctuating between conflict and convergence.The Iran-Russia relationship holds decisive implications for the Middle East's future, where their interests both overlap and diverge, notably in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and with the GCC. Tazmini delves into Russian and Iranian geopolitical aspirations in the Middle Eastern theatre and addresses how evolving international realities impact their regional policies. Through a blend of sophisticated theoretical analysis and empirical insights, Tazmini explains why Moscow-Tehran relations are more durable than many in the Western world and the Middle East may perceive. Russia and Iran's close alignment is expected to persist - undeterred by criticism and sanctions, the 'Power Couple' remains determined to establish a foothold in the international system through their collaborative efforts.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286880
286879	1	The ethics of special ops : | raids, recoveries, reconnaissance, and rebels /	Baker, Deane-Peter,	The field of military ethics has generally been attentive to emerging trends in modern warfare. Cyber, robotics and AI, for example, have inspired an abundant and flourishing literature. One trend, however, has been largely overlooked: the emergence of special operations as a prominent instrument of statecraft. Drawing extensively on historical cases and first-hand experience, the authors of this book call attention to qualities inherent in special operations - and special operators - that challenge the moral framework which has long informed conventional military operations. Moral theorists will find this analysis provocative, while practitioners - those who conduct or oversee special operations and have an interest in the moral wellbeing of special operators - can put the authors' insights to practical use. Those who simply view with fascination the opaque world of special operations will find this book illuminating.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286879
286878	1	Dynamics of the changing global security order : | Emerging Trends and Key Issues in Asia /		Dynamics of the Changing Global Security Order: Emerging Trends and Key Issues in Asia presents knowledge, insights and understanding of why and how the US-led unipolar world order is shifting more in a multipolar direction. It demonstrates the influence of power contests involving economic and military weaponry on this new development. It reveals the impact this transformation will have on international security (and the challenges, crises and risks that humanity faces).This volume systematically explores its hypothesis through newly evolving theoretical positions - such as geoeconomics; socio-economic-political and cultural implications; tensions at the national, regional, and global levels; as well as debates, trends, policies, practices, and examples concerning power and international relations praxis.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286878
286877	1	On wars /	Mann, Michael,	Mann examines the history of war through the ages and across the globe-from ancient Rome to Ukraine, from imperial China to the Middle East, from Japan and Europe to Latin and North America. He explores the reasons groups go to war, the different forms of wars, how warfare has changed and how it has stayed the same, and the surprising ways in which seemingly powerful countries lose wars. In combining ideological, economic, political, and military analysis, Mann offers new insight into the many consequences of choosing war.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286877
286876	1	AI, IoT, and blockchain breakthroughs in e-governance /		There is now a plethora of internet of things (IoT) devices on the market that can connect to the internet and the desired environment to produce sufficient and reliable data that is required by the government administration for a variety of purposes. Additionally, the potential benefits of incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into governance are numerous. Governments can use AI and machine learning to enforce the law, detect fraud, and monitor urban areas by identifying problems before they occur. The government can also use AI to easily automate processes and replace mundane and repetitive tasks. AI, IoT, and Blockchain Breakthroughs in E-Governance defines and emphasizes various AI algorithms as well as new internet of things and blockchain breakthroughs in the field of e-governance. Covering key topics such as machine learning, government, and artificial intelligence, this premier reference source is ideal for government officials, policymakers, researchers, academicians, practitioners, scholars, instructors, and students.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286876

286874	1	Inside the political mind : | the human side of politics and how it shapes development /	Power, Greg,	This book examines why political behaviour in developing countries so often deviates from outsiders' expectations--and not for the reasons you might think. Analysis of developing countries tends to be preoccupied with the seedier aspects of politics, finding explanations for lack of progress in vote-buying, clientelism and naked self-interest. But this ignores the question of why politicians, as people, do what they do. Drawing on the experiences of hundreds of MPs in some of the world's most complex environments, Greg Power explores their personal motivations and daily pressures in filling the gaps left by failing states. In countries as diverse as Iraq, Nepal, Ukraine and Tanzania, he shows how institutions work within highly informal political cultures, driven by public expectations, social norms, reciprocity and altruism. He reveals that development is determined as much by MPs' foibles and preferences as by the wider battle for power. Combining insights from political science, behavioural economics and business management, Power argues for a more human approach to political reform--one that starts with individuals, not institutions. His fascinating book shines new light on how politics works from the inside, and why the human element is central to making change happen where it really matters.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286874
286873	1	Centers of power in the Arab Gulf States /	Ulrichsen, Kristian Coates,	How are authority and influence accumulated and wielded across the six Gulf states? Mixing theoretical and empirical insights, and utilising both historical and contemporary examples, this book offers a comparative analysis of military, political, economic and religious power in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as of the power of narrative.While many volumes examine each of these states individually, 'Centers of Power in the Arab Gulf States' assesses the Arabian Peninsula as a whole, filling a significant gap in the literature. It surveys the myriad factors which have influenced the emergence of these states, societies and political economies, which have become increasingly assertive actors in today's global order.Exploring domestic, regional and transnational pressures, Kristian Coates Ulrichsen sheds light on the varying concepts of power and authority, the different forms they take, the ways they are projected, and the practical constraints on their exercise. From whom does power derive? Is it something different from influence and ambition? Is decision-making top-down or bottom-up, or a mixture of both? From bureaucrats to scholars, and from royals to opposition figures, Coates Ulrichsen uncovers the power relations shaping the Gulf today.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286873
286872	1	The small states club : | how small smart sowers can save the world /	Sarkissian, Armen,	In this book, Armen Sarkissian, former president of Armenia, argues that small states can navigate the complex challenges of the twenty-first century in smarter ways than 'greater' powers. For smallness-often regarded as a weakness-can be a strength. It may induce insecurity in states, but also endows them with an instinct for survival. Large states are ponderous; small states can be agile and adaptive.Drawing on his deep experience as a scientist, businessman, diplomat and head of state, Sarkissian offers captivating portraits of small states, from Africa to Europe to Asia, that have overcome seemingly insuperable odds to establish themselves as oases of political stability, cultural tolerance, technological innovation, financial prudence and scientific research. Sarkissian returns to the uncertain beginnings of these small states to demystify their improbable rise. Along the way, he introduces us to a cast of tenacious leaders with a knack for converting crisis into opportunity. Widely regarded as the most respected Armenian leader on the world stage, Sarkissian ends with a poignant homage to his motherland. Part memoir, part manifesto, it is a stirring insight into the world's oldest Christian country, which is at once an ancient civilization, a small state and a global nation.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286872
286871	1	Hamas in politics : | democracy, religion, violence /	Gunning, Jeroen,	In January 2006, Hamas, an organisation classified by Western governments as terrorist, was democratically elected to govern the Palestinian territories. The inherent contradictions in this situation have left many analysts at a loss. Hamas uses terror tactics against Israel, yet runs on a law and order ticket in Palestinian elections; it pursues an Islamic state, yet holds internal elections; it campaigns for shar'iah law, yet its leaders are predominantly secular professionals; it calls for the destruction of Israel, yet has reluctantly agreed to honour previous peace agreements. In "Hamas in Politics", Jeroen Gunning challenges the assumption that religion, violence and democracy are inherently incompatible and shows how many of these apparent contradictions flow from the interaction between Hamas' ideology, its local constituency and the nature of politics in Israel/Palestine. Drawing on interviews with members of Hamas and its critics, and a decade of close observation of the group, he offers a penetrating analysis of Hamas' own understanding of its ideology and in particular the tension between its dual commitment to 'God' and 'the people'. The book explores what Hamas' political practice says about its attitude towards democracy, religion and violence, providing a unique examination of the movement's internal organisation, how its leaders are selected and how decisions are made.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286871
286870	1	The AI military race : | common good governance in the age of Artificial Intelligence /	Garcia, Denise,	In The AI Military Race, Denise Garcia examines the complexities entailed in creating a global framework to govern the military use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by proposing inclusive and humane ways to forge cooperation. Three novel humanist conceptions are introduced: common good governance, transnational networked cooperation, and humanity's security. This academic volume is the first to survey the threats to peace in the shifting world order by investigating the current patterns and trends in the global use of, and investment in, militarizing AI and the development of autonomous systems. Garcia weaves in an insider participant-observer focus on the decade-long high-level diplomatic attempts to set limits in autonomy in weapons systems - known as 'killer robots' - and offers a path for the creation of an international treaty on autonomous weapons, and ways to create common good governance for the militarization of AI. This important study draws on earlier successful cooperation and international law-making in several areas including conventional arms, nuclear and chemical weapons bans, the protection of outer space and the ozone, the Arctic, Antarctica, and the oceans. It offers an appraisal of the way that previous successes in global cooperation can inform the formation of common good governance on AI that is respectful of future generations and protective of human dignity and the common good of humanity.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286870
286869	1	Foreign policy and security strategy /		Foreign Policy and Security Strategy collects works by the late Professor Martin Wight (1913-1972), an historian and scholar of international relations. Wight conducted research on many topics, including British colonial history, European studies, international institutions, and the history of states-systems. He is nonetheless best known for his lectures about the political philosophy of international relations at the London School of Economics (1949-1961) and the University of Sussex (1961-1972). He is widely regarded as an intellectual ancestor and pathbreaker of the "English School" of international relations, even though this term only gained currency nine years after his death. The "English School" is usually construed as signifying an approach to the study of international relations more rooted in historical and humanistic learning than in the social sciences. Despite Wight's reputation as a scholar focused on historical and philosophical matters, he articulated noteworthy policy prescriptions in six domains: (a) the balance of power; (b) international order, notably regarding neutrality and nationalism; (c) nuclear weapons and international politics; (d) interests, honour, and prestige in statecraft; (e) disarmament and public opinion; and (f) the United Nations. These writings have been neglected, partly because his perfectionism led him to refrain from publishing many of them. However, as this new collection of his works (many previously unpublished) shows, he took distinctive positions on practical policy questions. He asked "Does Peace Take Care of Itself?" - as implied by Kantian principles - and concluded that it does not, and that purposeful action will therefore be necessary.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286869
286868	1	Digital empires : | the global battle to regulate technology /	Bradford, Anu,	Financial Times Best Books of 2023 in Economics The global battle among the three dominant digital powers--the United States, China, and the European Union--is intensifying. All three regimes are racing to regulate tech companies, with each advancing a competing vision for the digital economy while attempting to expand its sphere of influence in the digital world. In Digital Empires, her provocative follow-up to The Brussels Effect, Anu Bradford explores a rivalry that will shape the world in the decades to come. Across the globe, people dependent on digital technologies have become increasingly alarmed that their rapid adoption and transformation have ushered in an exceedingly concentrated economy where a few powerful companies control vast economic wealth and political power, undermine data privacy, and widen the gap between economic winners and losers. In response, world leaders are variously embracing the idea of reining in the most dominant tech companies. Bradford examines three competing regulatory approaches--the American market-driven model, the Chinese state-driven model, and the European rights-driven regulatory model--and discusses how governments and tech companies navigate the inevitable conflicts that arise when these regulatory approaches collide in the international domain. Which digital empire will prevail in the contest for global influence remains an open question, yet their contrasting strategies are increasingly clear. Digital societies are at an inflection point. In the midst of these unfolding regulatory battles, governments, tech companies, and digital citizens are making important choices that will shape the future ethos of the digital society. Digital Empires lays bare the choices we face as societies and individuals, explains the forces that shape those choices, and illuminates the immense stakes involved for everyone who uses digital technologies.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286868

286866	1	Creative insecurity : | institutional inertia and youth potential in the GCC /	Thafer, Dania,	The Middle East is experiencing the world's most prominent youth bulge. Yet many MENA economies' institutional designs, both formal and informal, favour the power of business elites, systematically discriminating against young people joining the workforce or opening businesses, and thus limiting their ability to contribute to innovation. Large youth populations can be a boon or a curse: nurtured and integrated, they can jumpstart stratospheric growth; but if alienated and confined, they can drain a society politically and economically. The Gulf Cooperation Council countries are no exception to this perilous dilemma. This book explores the problem through a new concept, 'creative insecurity': a state's subjection to an institutional ecosystem that is suppressing opportunities for innovation--to the extent that it is causing economic and political vulnerabilities, which in turn threaten national security. Creative insecurity threatens the longevity of many states today. In this original, incisive study, Dania Thafer argues that GCC member-states should make it a national security imperative to cash in their demographic dividend, by averting the deleterious effects of ill-disposed elite politics. Investing in an innovation ecosystem that harnesses the talent of the youth majority will be crucial for the GCC's successful transition to the post-oil era.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286866
286865	1	Religious appeals in power politics /	Henne, Peter,	Religious Appeals in Power Politics examines how states use, or attempt to use, confessional appeals to religious belief and conscience to advance political strategies and objectives. Through case studies of the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, Peter S. Henne demonstrates that religion, although not as high profile or well-funded a tool as economic sanctions or threats of military force, remains a potent weapon in international relations. Public policy analysis often minimizes the role of religion, favoring military or economic matters as the "important" arenas of policy debate. As Henne shows, however, at transformative moments in political history, states turn to faith-based appeals to integrate or fragment international coalitions. Henne highlights Saudi Arabia's 1960s rivalry with Egypt, the United States's post-9/11 leadership in the global war on terrorism, and the Russian Federation's contemporary expansionism both to reveal the presence and power of calls for religious unity and to emphasize the uncertainty and anxiety such appeals can create. Religious Appeals in Power Politics offers a bold corrective to those who consider religion as tangential to military or economic might.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286865
286864	1	Information warfare in the age of cyber conflict /		This book examines the shape, sources and dangers of information warfare (IW) as it pertains to military, diplomatic and civilian stakeholders. Cyber warfare and information warfare are different beasts. Both concern information, but where the former does so exclusively in its digitized and operationalized form, the latter does so in a much broader sense: with IW, information itself is the weapon. The present work aims to help scholars, analysts and policymakers understand IW within the context of cyber conflict. Specifically, the chapters in the volume address the shape of influence campaigns waged across digital infrastructure and in the psychology of democratic populations in recent years by belligerent state actors, from the Russian Federation to the Islamic Republic of Iran. In marshalling evidence on the shape and evolution of IW as a broad-scoped phenomenon aimed at societies writ large, the authors in this book present timely empirical investigations into the global landscape of influence operations, legal and strategic analyses of their role in international politics, and insightful examinations of the potential for democratic process to overcome pervasive foreign manipulation. This book will be of much interest to students of cybersecurity, national security, strategic studies, defence studies and International Relations in general.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286864

286706	1	Oil spaces: | exploring the global petroleumscape /		Oil Spaces traces petroleum's impact through a range of territories from across the world, showing how industrially drilled petroleum and its refined products have played a major role in transforming the built environment in ways that are often not visible or recognized. Over the past century and a half, industrially drilled petroleum has powered factories, built cities, and sustained nation-states. It has fueled ways of life and visions of progress, modernity, and disaster. In detailed international case studies, the contributors consider petroleum's role in the built environment and the imagination. They study how petroleum and its infrastructure have served as a source of military conflict and political and economic power, inspiring efforts to create territories and reshape geographies and national boundaries. The authors trace ruptures and continuities between colonial and postcolonial frameworks, in locations as diverse as Sumatra, northeast China, Brazil, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kuwait as well as heritage sites including former power stations in Italy and the port of Dunkirk, once a prime gateway through which petroleum entered Europe. By revealing petroleum's role in organizing and imagining space globally, this book takes up a key task in imagining the possibilities of a post-oil future. It will be invaluable reading to scholars and students of architectural and urban history, planning, and geography of sustainable urban environments.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286706

286677	1	The Asian 21st century /	Mahbubani, Kishore,	This open access book consists of essays written by Kishore Mahbubani to explore the challenges and dilemmas faced by the West and Asia in an increasingly interdependent world village and intensifying geopolitical competition. The contents cover four parts: Part One The End of the Era of Western Domination. The major strategic error that the West is now making is to refuse to accept this reality. The West needs to learn how to act strategically in a world where they are no longer the number 1. Part Two The Return of Asia. From the years 1 to 1820, the largest economies in the world were Asian. After 1820 and the rise of the West, however, great Asian civilizations like China and India were dominated and humiliated. The twenty-first century will see the return of Asia to the center of the world stage. Part Three The Peaceful Rise of China. The shift in the balance of power to the East has been most pronounced in the rise of China. While this rise has been peaceful, many in the West have responded with considerable concern over the influence China will have on the world order. Part Four Globalization, Multilateralism and Cooperation. Many of the world's pressing issues, such as COVID-19 and climate change, are global issues and will require global cooperation to deal with. In short, human beings now live in a global village. States must work with each other, and we need a world order that enables and facilitates cooperation in our global village							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286677

286560	2	The Arab Gulf states and the west : | perceptions and realities - opportunities and perils /		This book examines the relations and image of the Arab Gulf states in the West. It addresses the question of Perception in International Relations and how the Arab States of the Gulf have pursued various endeavours to project themselves into the West. The book chapters generate ideas on how perceptions came about and ways to improve cultural and political realities on the ground in the Arab Gulf States. Thus, it paves the way for a new area of research in the field of Gulf Studies that extends beyond traditional international relations frameworks by weaving elements of intercultural communication into the mix. Recognizing, yet extending beyond, a traditionally realist framework, which had dominated the analysis of Arab Gulf States foreign relations with western countries, this book tackles both the materialist and the symbolic in the efforts and initiatives launched by the Arab Gulf States. Some chapters maintain a social-scientific approach about the politics of Arab Gulf States in the West from an International Relations lens. Others employ theoretical frameworks that were founded on the notion of the "encounter," with anthropological lenses and concepts of intercultural communication. In addition to the value of such an academic research agenda, some of the chapters touch upon the added importance of policy-oriented input. As the Arab Gulf States actively engage with the West, the book would widely appeal to students and researchers of Gulf politics and International Relations.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286560

286502	1	Artificial intelligence and international conflict in cyberspace /		"This edited volume explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming international conflict in cyberspace. Over the past three decades, cyberspace developed into a crucial frontier and issue of international conflict. However, scholarly work on the relationship between AI and conflict in cyberspace has been produced along somewhat rigid disciplinary boundaries and an even more rigid sociotechnical divide - wherein technical and social scholarship are seldomly brought into a conversation. This is the first volume to address these themes through a comprehensive and cross-disciplinary approach. With the intent of exploring the question 'what is at stake with the use of automation in international conflict in cyberspace through AI?', the chapters in the volume focus on three broad themes, namely: (1) technical and operational, (2) strategic and geopolitical, and (3) normative and legal. These also constitute the three parts in which the chapters of this volume are organised, although these thematic sections should not be considered as an analytical or a disciplinary demarcation. This book will be of much interest to students of cyber-conflict, artificial intelligence, security studies and International Relations"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286502

Part one, 'Military Systems and Technology',, approaches the theme empirically by researching how data can enhance the utility of military materiel and subsequently accelerate the decision-making process. Part two, 'War Studies', takes a multidisciplinary approach to the evolution of warfare, while the third part, 'Military Management Studies', takes a holistic organisational and procedural approach. Based on their scientific protocols and research methods, the three domains put forward different research questions and perspectives, providing the unique character of this book.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286500

286490	1	Asian perceptions of Gulf security /		"Gulf stability is coming to play a larger role in the foreign policy calculus of many states, but the evolving role of Asian powers is largely under-represented in the International Relations literature. This volume addresses this gap with a set of empirically rich, theory driven case studies written by academics from or based in the countries in question. The underlying assumption is not that Asian powers have already become important security actors in the Gulf, but rather that they perceive the Gulf as a region of increasing strategic relevance. How will leaders in these countries adjust to an evolving regional framework? Will there be coordinated efforts to establish an Asian-centered approach to Gulf stability, or will Asian rivalries make the region a theatre of competition? Will US-China tensions force alignment choices among Asian powers? Will Asian states balance, bandwagon, hedge, or adopt some other approach to their Gulf relationships? These questions become even more important as the western boundaries of Asia increasingly come to incorporate the Middle East. The book will appeal to scholars and students in the fields of International Relations, Security Studies, and International Political Economy, as well as area specialists on the Gulf and those working on foreign policy issues on each of the Asian countries included. Professionals in government and non-government agencies will also find it very useful"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286490
286489	1	Human-centered economics : | the living standards of nations /	Samans, Richard,	This open access book examines the chronic underperformance of economies with respect to inclusion, sustainability and resilience. It finds that the standard liberal economic growth and development model has evolved over the past century in a fundamentally unbalanced manner that underemphasizes the crucial role of institutions legal norms, policy incentives and public administrative capacities in translating market-based growth in the production of goods and services into broad and sustainable gains in social welfare at the household level. Correcting this imbalance of emphasis in economic theory and policy between markets and institutions, production and distribution, and national income and household living standards is the single most important step required to transcend 20th century trickle-down neoliberalism and replace it with a more human-centred model of economic progress in the 21st century. The book breaks new ground by integrating the principal institutional dimensions of the social contract into the heart of macroeconomic theory and presenting extensive corresponding reforms of domestic and international economic policy to refocus them on the median living standards, rather than primarily aggregate wealth or GDP, of nations. This is the bottom-line measure of national economic performance, and it depends on the strength of both markets of exchange and institutions in such areas as labour and social protection, financial and corporate governance, competition and rents, anti-corruption, infrastructure and basic necessities, environmental protection, education and skilling, etc. Extensive comparative data are presented demonstrating that countries at every level of economic development have ample policy space to narrow their welfare gaps their underperformance on these and other key aspects of household living standards relative to the frontier of leading policy practice in peer countries.

286488	1	Private sector development in an emerging world : | inclusive policies and strategies for the formal and informal economy /		This book explores the interactions between private sector development, public policies and societal institutions with a strong view on contributing to sustainable and inclusive development in emerging countries.    The private sector is often praised as an engine of economic growth. This belief has led to significant efforts to promote private sector development in emerging countries. Development agencies prioritize private sector development and national governments are following suit, resulting in often huge incentives to stimulate and attract private investment.    However, private sector development is not a panacea for sustainable and inclusive development as the past decades have clearly shown. Economic growth, societal development and environmental sustainability are often in a sharp conflict; and more often than not economic growth has failed to improve the lives of all citizens.    This book examines the role the state and the private sector should play to benefit from the dynamics of business development, while ensuring that these benefits are shared broadly without jeopardizing sustainability. The views presented differ in detail, but the analyses and case studies presented share common themes, namely that the relative roles of state and private sector of should be balanced and that this particular balance should be based on the context of each country in order to make the private-public sector interaction work for all people.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286488

286446	1	Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0: | explorations in the transition from a techno-economic to a socio-technical future /		This is an Open Access book. In 2015, Industry 4.0 was announced with the rise of industrialization by the European Parliament, supporting policy, research, and infrastructure funding. In 2020, Industry 5.0 was launched as an evolution of Industry 4.0, towards societal and ecological values in a sustainable, human-centric, and resilient transition. In 2023, the IN4ACT research project team completed 4 years of research on the impact on these initiatives. Presentations reviewing the progress of management practices and economics led to conversations about what's next. The unanticipated rise in late 2022 of Generative AI technologies (e.g. ChatGPT, DALL-E) sparked dialogues with an extended circle of researchers on impacts not considered in 2015 or in 2020. This collection of chapters reflects multiple perspectives on research findings to 2023, prospects for 2024, and considerations on ways the techno-economic industrial revolutions may be reshaped into desirable futures respecting social and ecological concerns.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286446
286445	1	Social touch in human-robot interaction : | symbiotic touch interaction between human and robot /		In this book for researchers and students, editors Shiomi and Sumioka bring together contributions from researchers working on the CREST project at ATR Deep Interaction Laboratories, a world leader in social robotics, to comprehensively describe robot touch systems from hardware to applications. Appropriate touch from robots to humans is essential for social robots, but achieving this requires various solutions at every stage of the touch process. Through this book, readers will gain an understanding of the needs, essential systems and communication cues, behaviour designs, and real-world issues for social touch applications. This book compiles and updates technical and empirical research that was previously scattered throughout the literature into a single volume. Through individually authored chapters addressing various elements of ATR's CREST project, this book tackles key areas where understanding is needed to realize acceptable touch interaction, including pre-touch interaction, interaction design for touching and being touched, behaviour changes caused by touch interaction, and applications of social touch interaction. It introduces a touch sensor and robots developed by the authors, including several touch-related behaviours and design policies. This approach will enable readers to easily apply this knowledge to their own social robotics programs. This book is invaluable for anyone who wishes to understand and develop social robots that physically interact with people. It is most beneficial for researchers and upper undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of human-robot/agent/computer interaction and social touch interaction and those in the broader fields of engineering, computer science, and cognitive science.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286445
286444	1	The ethics of national security intelligence institutions : | theory and applications /	Henschke, Adam,	"This book explores the ethics of national security intelligence institutions operating in contemporary liberal democracies. Intelligence collection by agencies such as the CIA, MI6, and Mossad involves practices that are apparently inconsistent with the principles of ordinary morality - practices such as lying, spying, manipulation, and covert action. However, in the defence of national security, such practices may not only be morally permissible, but may also under some circumstances be morally obligatory. One approach to the ethics of national security intelligence activity has been to draw from the just war tradition (so-called 'just intelligence theory'). This book identifies significant limitations of this approach and offers a new, institutionally based, teleological normative framework. In doing so, it revises some familiar principles designed for application to kinetic wars, such as necessity and proportionality, and invokes some additional ones, such as reciprocity and trust. It goes on to explore the applications of this framework and a revised set of principles for national security intelligence institutions and practices in contemporary and emerging political and technological settings. This book will be of much interest to students of intelligence studies, ethics, security studies and International Relations"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286444
286443	1	Women's empowerment and public policy in the Arab Gulf States : | exploring challenges and opportunities /		This open access book explores the various dimensions of women's empowerment in public policy in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), with a particular focus on Qatar, comparing the country to the other Gulf states. Through its rich compilation of empirical qualitative research, the text unpacks the various ways in which women's empowerment materializes in the GCC context, providing insights into public policy perspectives in high-income rentier states more broadly. The Arab world has long been part of the global dialogue on women's economic and political empowerment and the GCC has, over the past decade, situated women's empowerment amongst their respective national priorities and long-term strategies. In turn, the Gulf has seen gradual implementation of policies aimed at women, specifically, in looking to attract and retain them in the labour market, and in the public sector more broadly. The collection surveys and evaluates the progress made in recent decades, paying close attention to the cultural and policy constraints still limiting women's empowerment in the Gulf. With a key linkage to SDG5, this book is a timely text addressing the context and drivers behind policies centering on women in the Arab region, in its analysis of the interplay of international women's empowerment discourse and regional public policy decisions. It is relevant to researchers and policy makers focused on women and gender issues in relation to social, cultural, economic, and political empowerment in the Gulf specifically, but also in the Arab world and beyond							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286443
286442	1	Social change in the Gulf Region : | multidisciplinary perspectives /		This open access book, comprising thirty-nine chapters divided into social, cultural, economic, and political spheres, offers a unique opportunity to dive into the complex, dynamic, and sometimes contradictory transformation of Gulf societies in the last few decades. Whilst the Gulf region has at times been seen as impervious to this natural phenomenon of transformation -- timeless, never changing, deeply rooted in its ancient tribal customs and traditions and able to blend past and present seamlessly without suffering the wrenching trauma of change -- this is clearly not the case, and the region is not immune to the inevitable forces of social change. There is no doubt today that the social change sweeping the Gulf has been profound, affecting almost every aspect of life in the Gulf societies. This volume has an encyclopedic value as the chapters collectively offer multifaceted and multidisciplinary perspectives to understand social change in the Gulf region. Through these chapters, the role of economic and educational transformation, and the impact of social media, migration, and urbanization have in driving social change in the Gulf societies is examined in detail with a focus on their directions, magnitudes, and relevant policy options. It also considers how COVID-19 is affecting the lives of the people in the Gulf. This book bridges gaps in the understanding of the rapid pace of social change in the Gulf, offering practical solutions for policy interventions. It is of interest to scholars and students in Middle Eastern studies, specifically, as well as sociology, media studies, migration studies, and educational policy							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286442
286441	1	Sustainable Qatar : | social, political and environmental perspectives /		This open access book provides a topical overview of the key sustainability issues in Qatar, focusing on environmental sustainability from a socio-political perspective. The transition to a sustainable Qatar requires engagement with diverse areas of social-political, human, and environmental development. On the environmental aspects, the contributors address climate change, food security, water reuse and desalination, energy, and biodiversity. The socio-political section examines state strategy and regulation, the place of environmental law and geopolitics and sustainability innovators and catalysts. The human section considers economics, sustainability education, the knowledge economy, and waste management. In doing so, the book demarcates the ways in which the country encounters and grapples with significant challenges and delves into the range of options for future pathways to sustainability in Qatar. Relevant to policymakers and scholars in energy and environment, urban and developmental studies, as well as the arenas of politics, climate change and policy, this book is a landmark collection on environmental policy in the Gulf and beyond							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286441

286165	2	الهجرة القسرية في البلدان العربية /‎	حسين، أحمد قاسم،‎	ما من منطقة في العالم تتأثر بالهجرة القسرية حاليًّا بالقدر نفسه الذي تتأثر به منطقة البلدان العربية؛ إذ يمثّل سكان هذه المنطقة 5 في المئة من سكان العالم، لكنها تستضيف 32 في المئة من اللاجئين و38 في المئة من النازحين داخليًّا؛ بسبب مشكلات الفقر المزمنة، وازدياد حدة الحروب ووتيرتها، واستفحال تأثير التحولات المناخية والتغيّر البيئي، والتنقل الحضري.    يُعدّ هذا الكتاب مساهمةً في فهم ظاهرة الهجرة القسرية في البلدان العربية وتحليلها، وهو يتناول الظاهرة في ثلاثة محاور. ففي المحور الأول، يسلط الضوء على جوانب قانونية متعلقة باللاجئين والنازحين. وفي المحور الثاني، يعالج أبعادًا مختلفة لمشكلات اللجوء والنزوح القسري ويبحث في الحلول الممكنة لهذه المشكلات. أمّا في المحور الأخير، فيحلّل تجارب أوروبية في التعامل مع الهجرة القسرية من البلدان العربية. ¦ تعتمد حكومات العالم المتقدم في الوقت الراهن لغة اقتسام أعباء ما يتصل بمسألة التعامل مع اللاجئين؛ وهو أمرٌ يعزز نوعًا من الفصل العنصري العالمي، بحسب تعبير هاثاواي؛ وذلك بسبب انتماء معظم اللاجئين إلى العالم الأقل تقدّمًا. لقد شوّهت بعض الدول الغربية الهدف الحقيقي للاتفاقية الخاصة بوضع اللاجئين - على قصورها - من خلال ادعاء أنها تهتم بتحديد التزامات حماية اللاجئين في "الملاذ الأخير" فحسب؛ أي إنه يجوز إرسال اللاجئين روتينيًّا إلى أي دولة أخرى تَقبلهم، من دون تعريضهم لخطر الإعادة القسرية إلى أوطانهم الأصلية. وتستخدم هذه الحكومات حزمةً من المغريات والضغوط حتى تجبر الحكومات المرشحة لأن تكون دولها ملاذًا أخيرًا على قبول مثل هذه الصفقات. وفي الوقت نفسه، تلجأ بعض حكومات العالم المتقدم إلى تكييف وضع اللاجئين من المهاجرين غير القانونيين الذين يكون وصولهم مفاجئًا، على الرغم من أن الاتفاقية تنص على خلاف ذلك.  ويُعتبر القانون الدولي للجوء أبطأ فرعٍ من فروع القانون الدولي العام حركةً وتطورًا؛ فمن حيث الصكوك، لم يشهد هذا القانون أيّ تحديث جذري لصكوكه القديمة التي تعود إلى سياقات آثار الحرب العالمية الثانية. ومن حيث آليات الحماية، لم تتطور منظومته لاستحداث إجراءات شبه قضائية على شاكلة منظومة القانون الدولي لحقوق الإنسان، فضلًا عن أن تستحدث إجراءات قضائية على غرار القانون الجنائي الدولي. وقد أحدث هذا كلّه في داخله قصورًا في الجانبين: الصكوك والآليات؛ ما يدفع، في كثير من الأحيان، إلى الرجوع إلى صكوك القانون الدولي لحقوق الإنسان وآلياته.  وبغضّ النظر عن ضعف تصديق الدول الخمس المدروسة على الاتفاقيات الدولية الأساسية المتعلقة باللجوء تعلقًا مباشرًا أو غير مباشر - حيث إن موضوع البحث لا يتمثّل في معاملة الدول للاجئين الأجانب على أراضيها، بل في موضوع تَسبّبها في كارثة لجوء عالمية لحقت بمواطنيها؛ كما هو الشأن في حالة مواطنين سوريين مثلًا - فإن أنجع الآليات المتاحة بالنسبة إلى اللاجئين الذين ينحدرون من تلك الدول الخمس هي الآليات غير التعاهدية على مستوى نظام الأمم المتحدة لحماية حقوق الإنسان. أما المقيمون في إحدى دول الاتحاد الأوروبي، فإن آليات المحكمة الأوروبية لحقوق الإنسان تُعدّ أكثر نجاعة من بين كل النظم الإقليمية الأخرى، بل إنها تفوق في درجة فاعليتها النظام غير التعاهدي للأمم المتحدة؛ بالنظر إلى أن الآليات القضائية تكون دائمًا أشد إلزامًا وفاعلية من الآليات شبه القضائية. وفي نهاية الأمر، نحن نتحدث عن محكمة أوروبية تُعدّ قراراتها ملزمة لدول الاتحاد الأوروبي، مقارنةً بلجان الأمم المتحدة التي ليس في وسعها سوى الضغط السياسي والإلزام الأدبي.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286165

286151	2	تأثير الثورات العربية في النظام الإقليمي العربي 2011-2019 = Impact of Arab revolutions on the arab regional order /	هيكل، فتوح أبو دهب صادق	مر النظام الإقليمي العربي منذ نشأته رسمياً عام 1945 بمراحل تطور ارتبطت أساساً بأحداث مفصلية فارقة ألقت بتأثيراتها الواضحة على هذا النظام وقدراته وتوازناته الداخلية وعلاقاته الإقليمية والدولية، مثل نكبة عام 1948، وثورة 23 تموز/يوليو 1952 في مصر وموجة المد القومي التي أعقبتها، وهزيمة عام 1967، وحرب تشرين الأول/أكتوبر 1973، وما تلاها من توقيع اتفاقية كامب دايفيد ومعاهدة السلام المصرية- الإسرائيلية عام 1979، وحرب الخليج الثانية عام 1990، وأحداث الحادي عشر من أيلول/سبتمبر 2001  وما تلاها من غزو أمريكي للعراق واحتلاله عام 2003.وإذا كان كل حدث أو تطور من هذه التطورات قد ترك أثره في النظام الإقليمي العربي، فإن موجة الثورات والانتفاضات الشعبية العربية في العقد الأخير، تمثل بلا شك أحد مراحل التحول المهمة التي مر، ولا يزال يمر بها، هذا النظام، في ضوء ما أفرزته هذه الثورات والانتفاضات من نتائج وتغيرات في مجمل المشهد الإقليمي العربي.تبحث هذه الدراسة في تأثير الثورات والانتفاضات الشعبية التي شهدها بعض البلدان العربية منذ أواخر عام 2010 في النظام الإقليمي العربي من حيث طبيعة هذا النظام وبنيته الداخلية، وهويته ومؤسساته وقضاياه الرئيسية، وتوازنات القوى داخله، وأنماط تحالفاته الداخلية والخارجية، وعلاقته ببيئتيه الإقليمية والدولية، في محاولة لإيجاد إطار تفسيري لفهم التحولات التي شهدها هذا النظام في سياق هذه الموجة من الثورات والانتفاضات، ومحاولة التعرف إلى مستقبله في ضوء النتائج والتطورات التي أفرزتها.يتضمن الكتاب خمسة فصول، فضلاً عن المقدمة والخاتمة والمراجع والفهرس.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286151
286150	2	الفجوة الغذائية وإشكالية تحقيق الأمن الغذائي : | مقاربة اقتصادية قياسية /	السلامي، أسماء	تُعتبر الحبوب من أهم مجاميع المحاصيل النباتية، بالنظر لأهميتها في توفير الأمن الغذائي للسكان، فهي أهم مصادر الغذاء في العالم، على صعيدي الاستهلاك البشري المباشر، وفي شكل غير مباشر كمدخلات في الانتاج الحيواني. لذلك، فإن تطورات قطاع الحبوب تبقى حاسمة بالنسبة إلى الإمدادات الغذائية للدول. في هذا الصدد، بلغ الإنتاج العالمي للحبوب في عام 2021 مستوى قياسيا قدره 2817 مليون طن، بارتفاع قدره 1.7% (47.8 مليون طن) عما كان عليه في عام 2020، في حين قُدر انتاج المنطقة العربية في عام 2019 بنحو 57.59 مليون طن بما يمثل 1.75% من الإنتاج العالمي من الحبوب. وقد ساهمت مجموعة الحبوب بنحو 56.19% من إجمالي قيمة فجوة السلع الغذائية الرئيسية في الوطن العربي. أما في الجزائر فتميز عام 2018 بإنتاج كبير بلغت قيمته 60.57 مليون قنطار من الحبوب بجميع الفئات مجتمعة، بزيادة قدرها 75 % عن عام 2017/2018 (أكثر من 25 مليون قنطار). ثم لينتعش الإنتاج في عام 2019 إلى نحو 60.79 مليون قنطار من الحبوب، لينخفض الإنتاج في 2020 إلى نحو 48.75 مليون قنطار، أي حوالي 20% أقل من المستوى القياسي لعام 2019 نتيجة للجفاف الذي خيم على المناطق الغربية للجزائر، ويقدر انتاج الحبوب موسم حصاد 2021 بنحو 3.5 مليون طن، في حين قدرت فيه الاحتياجات السنوية بأكثر من 8 مليون طن في المتوسط. ولازالت حجة الظروف المناخية غير المواتية لزراعة الحبوب في الجزائر هي السبب رغم أن قطاع الفلاحة هو من أهم الموارد البديلة لمداخيل معظم الدول الأجنبية. لكن حتى في سنوات الإنتاج المحلي الوفير، فإن الجزائر تعتمد اعتمادًا كبيرًا على واردات الحبوب، وخاصة القمح ؛ ففي السنوات الخمس الماضية، استوردت الجزائر في المتوسط حوالي 7.6 مليون طن من القمح سنويا، وهو ما يمثل حوالي 70% من استخدامها المحلي، ونظرًا لانخفاض الحصاد المحلي في عام 2021، فإن متطلبات استيراد القمح للسنة التسويقية 2021/2022 بلغت ما قيمته 8.1 مليون طن، أي أعلى بنحو 25% من واردات العام السابق و 7% فوق المتوسط. لذا تُعد الجزائر مستوردا رئيسيا للحبوب في العالم، نظرا لعدم كفاية الكميات المنتجة محليا منها، ما يدفعها لاستيراد كميات كبيرة منها لسد العجز في الفجوة الغذائية المسجلة رغم الإمكانات الزراعية المعتبرة التي تتمتع بها الجزائر القارة، حيث حلت خلال الموسم 2019/2020 في المرتبة السادسة عالميا من حيث استيراد القمح والمرتبة الثانية افريقيا بعد مصر، وبلغت الكمية المستوردة من القمح الى نحو 6.5 مليون طن. ووفقا لقاعدة بيانات منظمة الأغذية والزراعة للأمم المتحدة FAO، استوردت الجزائر من الحبوب لعام 2019 نحو 11.4 مليون طن. هذا ما جعل فاتورة استيراد الحبوب ثقيلة، حيث بلغت 2.53 مليار دولار في 2019. وهذا ما أدى إلى أن تعاني الجزائر من فجوة غذائية كبيرة في الإمدادات الغذائية من شعبة الحبوب، وتشكل خطرا حقيقيا على الأمن الغذائي وعلى تحقيق الاكتفاء الذاتي لمحصول الحبوب الإستراتيجي الذي يعرف قيما متدنية جدا، وهو ما يضع تحديات استراتيجية أمام الجزائر تتعلق بأمنها الغذائي. فالجزائر ورغم تحقيقها للمرتبة الأولى إفريقيا في مجال الأمن الغذائي في آخر تصنيف لبرنامج الأغذية العالمي التابع للأمم المتحدة، أين حلت في المرتبة 54 من بين 113 دولة شملها مؤشر الأمن الغذائي العالمي Global Food Security Index لسنة 2021، إلا أنها تُعد مرتبة متوسطة بالمقارنة مع الإمكانيات الزراعية التي تملكها الجزائر، فبالرغم من أنها أكبر دولة إفريقية مساحة وبالرغم من وفرة الأراضي، حيث أن مساحة الجزائر تبلغ نحو 2.4 مليون كم2، إلا أن الأراضي الصالحة للزراعة تقدر بنحو 3.15% من هذه المساحة، وهو ما يعادل 7.5 مليون هكتار حسب بيانات عام 2018، في حين تبلغ المساحة المستغلة فعليا بنحو 1.7% من المساحة هذه فقط. هذا ما جعل الجزائر لا تحرز تقدما يُعتد به في اتجاه سياساتها المتعلقة بتحسين معدلات الاكتفاء الذاتي استنادا إلى الغذاء المنتج محليا، بعيدا عن حساسيات المصادر الخارجية. خصوصا على صعيد الحبوب ؛ حيث لم يكفِ الانتاج لتقليص الاعتماد على الواردات الغذائية، والتي تشكل فيها الحبوب حوالي 50% من القيمة الكلية لواردات السلع الغذائية. فبُعيد الاستقلال كانت الجزائر تنتج نحو 90% من الحبوب، حين كانت تُلقب بـ " مطمورة روما " أين كان الفلاحين يحصدون القمح مرتين في السنة، ما يؤكد على أن الجزائر كانت قوة اقتصادية، بفضل الإنتاج الوفير من القمح الذي كانت تستعمله كسلاح أخضر ضد أعدائها، لكن حاليا تبلغ هذه النسبة حوالي 20% فقط، لتتحول الجزائر إلى دولة مستوردة له وبامتياز. وفي الحقيقية فاستمرار لجوء الجزائر إلى السوق الدولية لتغطية احتياجاتها من الحبوب خلال كل موسم حصاد، سيشكل عبئا اقتصاديا كبيرا على ميزانية الدولة ويطرح خطرا كبيرا على الاقتصاد الوطني، حيث يعمل على إضعاف أرصدته من العملة الصعبة، ويعزز مديونيته، ومن ثم تبعيته الاقتصادية والسياسية وحتى الثقافية، وهذا ليس له ما يبرره من الناحية الاقتصادية. وبالنظر لأهمية الكشف عن المتغيرات المؤثرة على حجم الفجوة الغذائية للحبوب في الجزائر، واستشعارا بأهمية رصد واقعها ومدى تأثيرها على تحقيق الاكتفاء الذاتي، فضلا عن ذلك، فإن دراسة مستقبل الفجوة الغذائية للحبوب باستخدام الطرق التقليدية والطرق الحديثة ممثلة في الشبكات العصبية الاصطناعية يُعد من الجوانب المهمة في تقييم حالة الأمن الغذائي للدولة، وبالتالي برمجة الإنتاج وفقا للحاجة الاستهلاكية ومقدار نمو الطلب، ومقدار الكمية الواجب استيرادها أو زراعتها. في هذا السياق تتبلور الإشكالية الرئيسية التي نسعى لمعالجتها من خلال السؤال الرئيسي التالي : ما أهم المحددات المسؤولة عن تقلبات الفجوة الغذائية للحبوب؟ وهل هناك أفضلية في تطبيق نموذج الشبكات العصبية الاصطناعية على نموذج بوكس جنكنز في استشراف آفاق هذه الفجوة؟ لمعالجة هذه الإشكالية والعمل على الإحاطة بالجوانب التي تشكل محاور هذا البحث، عملنا على تحليلها إلى الأسئلة الفرعية التالية : 1. كيف تؤثر الإنتاجية ومساحة الأراضي المنتجة في حجم الفجوة الغذائية للحبوب؟ 2. هل يؤثر نمو نصيب الفرد من الدخل وزيادة نسبة السكان على حجم الفجوة الغذائية للحبوب؟ 3. هل تمكن الاقتصاد الجزائري من تحقيق الاكتفاء الذاتي في مجال الحبوب في كافة مراحله؟ 4. كيف تؤثر الفجوة الغذائية للحبوب في تقلبات معدل الاكتفاء الذاتي في الجزائر؟ 5. ما هي الآفاق المستقبلية للفجوة الغذائية للحبوب في الفترة (2025-2020) ؟ 6. هل هناك أفضلية في تطبيق نموذج الشبكات العصبية الاصطناعية على نموذج بوكس جنكنز في استشراف آفاق الفجوة الغذائية للحبوب؟							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286150

286145	2	التنافس الأمريكي-الروسي على دول الجذب الاستراتيجي بعد العام 2000 : | (أوكرانيا وسوريا أنموذجا) /	الساعدي، ماهر سعدون خوشي صبار	يتناول هذا الكتاب موضوع التنافس بين الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية وروسيا الاتحادية على دول الجذب الاستراتيجي بعد العام 2000، حيث يحتل هذا الموضوع أهمية بالغة وفيه محاولة لدراسة جوهر التنافس الأمريكي-الروسي على تلك الدول نظرا للمؤهلات التي يمكن أن توفرها هذه الدول كمتطلب للدول الكبرى في سعي كل منهما للحصول على مكانة متميزة في النظام الدولي.    هناك العديد من النقاط المشتركة التي بإمكانها أن تقرب أو تبعد المسافة بين الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية وروسيا الاتحادية بعد الحرب الباردة، فمنها على سبيل المثال انتهاج كل منهما للمنهجية الواقعية والمصلحة في رسم علاقاتهما الدولية، إذ قد تلتقي مصالحهما في قضية ما وقد تختلف، ولا سيما عندما يتعلق الأمر بتنافس الأدوار في الأقاليم ذات القيمة الاستراتيجية لتلك المناطق، والأهمية الجيواستراتيجية العالية لمصلحة أي منهما كإقليم البلقان وإقليم آسيا الوسطى والقوقاز ومنطقة الشرق الأوسط، وإن المتتبع لطبيعة ومسار العلاقات الأمريكية – الروسية تكشف أن فوارق نوعية عدة حكمت العلاقة التي يمكن تسميتها بانها جديدة في معادلات التفاعل الدولي بعد انتهاء الحرب الباردة، ومما لا شك فيه إن هذا النمط من العلاقة أملئه أوضاع النشاة بهيمنة الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية مؤقته على النظام السياسي الدولي، واقترن ذلك برفضها بروز قوی دولية أخرى منافسة، ولاسيما إن الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية لا تغفل حقيقة إن روسيا الاتحادية تستطيع إعادة التوازن الدولي في العلاقات الدولية عبر التحالفات الإستراتيجية، ولاسيما إنها تؤدي دورا مهما في السياسات العالمية، فهي لا تستطيع أن تقف جانبا وتراقب سلسلة التغييرات في ميزان القدرة العسكرية والاستراتيجية، لذلك فهي تسعى لإعادة ترتيب أدوارها الإقليمية والدولية وفقا لإمكانات توازن القوى في المستقبل البعيد أو القريب، ولا يعني إطلاق إسقاطها لإمكانات توازن المصالح من تلك الأدوار لسبب بسير ومنهجي وهو إن توازن المصالح يعتمد بالأساس على توازن القوى، فعندما تتوازن القوى بين الدول تتوازن مصالحها أيضأ، أي، أن توازنات القوى القائمة تلبي مصالحها جميعا سواء كانت وطنية أو قومية أو عالمية فما تنشده روسيا الاتحادية من إعادة توازن القوى مع الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية، لا يعني الصراع من أجل بلوغ أعلى مراتب القوى التي تتيح لها تهديد المصالح الأمريكية الحيوية في العالم، أو تهديد الأمن القومي الأمريكي مثلما كان يفعل الإتحاد السوفيتي السابق فهذا السيناريو غير ممكن أو يصعب تحقيقه، بعد أن فقدت روسيا الإتحادية خطابها الإيديولوجي وأصبحت أكثر اندماج في العالم الغربي الرأسمالي ودخلت في عولمته بمظاهرها السياسية والاقتصادية والاجتماعية والقيمية كافة وتشابكت مصالحها مع الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية إلى الحد الذي لم تعد تتنظر فيه الأخيرة لروسيا الاتحادية وكأنها العدو القريب.    ومن ثم حاولت روسيا الإتحادية إرجاع فونها ومكانتها الدولية وسرعان ما بدأت العلاقات بين الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية وروسيا الإتحادية تتجه شيئا فشيئا نحو التنافس، لاسيما حول مناطق الجذب الاستراتيجي بالنسبة لهما، وذلك بسبب التحول الكبير على مستوى الاستراتيجية الروسية نتيجة التغيير على مستوى القيادة في روسيا الإتحادية منذ عام 2000، وبروز مظاهر التعافي الاقتصادي في روسيا الاتحادية وذلك بسبب العديد من العوامل الداخلية والخارجية، فروسيا الاتحادية في ظل حكم الرئيس الروسي فلاديمير بوتين، بدأت تعمل على تعزيز قوتها الشاملة وتسعى لاستعادة مكانتها العالمية وحماية مصالحها الاستراتيجية في العديد من المناطق خاصة في منطقة الشرق الأوسط (سوريا) ومناطق مجالها الحيوي (أوكرانيا). التوجه الروسي الجديد لمحاولة استعادة نفوذها القديم في مناطق الجذب الاستراتيجي قابلة تحرك امريكي حثيث في محاولة منع أي دخول روسي إلى المناطق ذات القيمة الاستراتيجية العليا بالنسبة للولايات المتحدة الأمريكية، ونتيجة لذلك عاد التنافس من جديد بين القوتين في الجانبين الجيوبولتيكي والطاقوي في تلك المناطق، بسعي إذ كلاهما إلى ترتيب أولوياته والعمل على صياغة استراتيجية تتلاءم مع مصالحه وأهدافه وأمكاناتها.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286145

286140	2	أزمات الحرب (الأوكرانية-الروسية) ومستقبل الإرهاب /		ينضوي هذا الكتاب جغرافيا في خانة إصدارات سابقة تطرقت إلى دراسة الإسلام والسياسة في آسيا الوسطى وشمال القوقاز، والمحافظة المسيحية في أوراسيا والتيارات القومية في روسيا، والآثار الجيوسياسية لأحداث أفغانستان. ويتقاطع في المحتوى مع مسارين للمشروعات البحثية: تخصص الأول في دراسة التطرف الديني والقومي والمحافظ وانكب الثاني على رصد ظروف تشكل الملاذات الآمنة والمحاضن التي توفر للجماعات الإرهابية بيئة ملائمة للتدريب والتجريب والتجنيد. تطرقت الدراسات إلى التعريف القانوني لمفهوم المقاتلين الأجانب وانشغلت بنشاطهم منذ عام 2014 وتداعيات تمدد التنظيمات المتطرفة في أوكرانيا، وبحثت في ظاهرة الإرهاب في القوقاز وآسيا الوسطى، ثم درست التيارات القومية في أوكرانيا، وقاست التأثيرات المحتملة على القارة الأوروبية والشرق الأوسط، وقارنت بين الأفغان العرب والمقاتلين العائدين المحتملين من أوكرانيا، وقيمت الموقف من النزعات الانفصالية.  يؤدي تصدُّع الجبهة العالمية؛ وتفاقم الاستقطابات، إلى بروز ثغرات تتسرّب عبرها جماعات اللادولة، ويتربح منها مقاولو التطرف، فتترسخ الدعاوى التعصبيّة والشوفينية القومية. لذا مثّل تفاقم الصراع الأطلسي- الروسي؛ واجتياح القوات الروسية الأراضي الأوكرانيّة، حدثًا مقلقًا لدارسي التطرّف والإرهاب؛ لما تحمله الحرب من آثارٍ إنسانية مقلقة، وما تجره من عواقبَ اقتصادية وخيمة، ونزاعٍ فكريّ يؤججُ التطرّف، قبل أن يتضاعف هذا القلق مع الدعوات لانضمام مقاتلين غير نظاميين للتطوّع والقتال تحت لواء أحد جانبي الصراع! ولبّت النداء قوميّات متنافرة؛ وجنود سابقون؛ ومقاتلون؛ يزعم أن بعضهم سبق له القتال في جماعات إرهابية. وقد تسببت ظاهرة «المقاتلين الأجانب» بوجهها الجديد، في ارتباكٍ أثار النقاش حول متانة المفاهيم الأساسية للإرهاب والتطرف والقومية والمحافظة، واليمين، والانفصال، بل وبُعِثت جدالات ظنّ العالم أنّها قُبِرت بانتهاء الحرب العالمية الثانية، أو أقله مع انهيار جدار برلين (1989).  بدأ الكتاب، بتعريف قانوني لمفهوم المقاتلين الأجانب، ثم انشغل بنشاطهم في أوكرانيا منذ عام 2014؛ وتداعيات تمدد التنظيمات المتطرفة فيها، وصولاً إلى بحث ظاهرة الإرهاب في القوقاز وآسيا الوسطى، ثم درس التيارات القومية في أوكرانيا، وصولاً إلى قياس التأثيرات المحتملة على القارة الأوروبية والشرق الأوسط، مرورًا بمحاكمة فكرة مقارنة الأفغان العرب، بالمقاتلين العائدين المحتملين من أوكرانيا، وتقيّيم الموقف من النزعات الانفصالية.  تصدرت الكتاب دراسة مفاهيمية عن البُعد القانوني لمفهوم المتطوعين والمقاتلين الأجانب المنخرطين في النزاع، فحاكمت المشروعية القانونية، وبيّنت ما يترتب عليها، في معايير حقوق الإنسان، والقانون الدولي، قدمتها الباحثة والقانونية اللبنانية فاتن فرج، مستكملةً بها دراسات سابقة، عن جدلية تعريف الإرهاب.تناولت دراسة ثانية الزاوية الميدانية لظاهرة المقاتلين الأجانب في أوكرانيا منذ عام 2014، فركّزت على تنامي ظاهرة الجماعات المسلحة الأممية، وانخراطها في نزاعات خارج حدود بلدانها الأصلية، ومبررات استعانة طرفي النزاع الروسي والأوكراني بها. أشارت الدراسة استنادًا إلى مصادر أوروبية إلى أن نحو ثلث قتلى الجانب الروسي الذين تم رصد أسمائهم –في الحرب الراهنة- ليسوا من العِرق السُّلافي! حاول الباحث أن يجد أدوات الربط بين الكتائب القومية الأوكرانية، وبعض العناصر الأوروبية، قبل أن يُحذّر بحسم من «عسكرة حركات اليمين المتطرف»، في ظلّ الدعائية القومية التنافسية، والأبعاد الدينية والهوياتية للصراع.  كانت حركة المقاتلين من أوكرانيا، وإليها، محلّ دراسة غطت تمدد التنظيمات المتطرفة في أوكرانيا وتداعياته؛ لقد تحوّلت منطقة شرق أوكرانيا منذ عام 2014، إلى بؤرة تجّمع لمعارضي روسيا وحلفائها. وعلى الرغم من أنّ الدراسة أشارت إلى جهود أوكرانيّة أدت إلى القبض على البراء الشّيشاني في 2019 في كييف، فإنّها لفتت إلى بقائه مستترًا فيها بأمان لمدة عامين، مما يدلّ على الرخاوة الأمنيّة في التعامل مع المتطرفين الشيشان في أوكرانيا.  زعمت الدراسة أن المقاتلين الشيشان المتحدرين من منطقة بانكيسي (Pankisi) الجورجية، يعودون من القتال في سوريا إلى أوكرانيا مباشرةً، محتمين بجبال الكاربات (Carpathian Mountains)، ومستغلين ثغرات قانونية، أزعجت الولايات المتحدة والاتحاد الأوروبي من أوكرانيا، إذ تجمعت بعد 2014 قوات شيشانية «معادية لروسيا»، وبدأت تُجمّع مقاتليها من «دول أوروبية» في كتائب أشهرها كتيبة جوهر دوداييف، وتنظيمات أحمد زكاييف. بعد انطلاق الحرب، نُقل نحو مئتي مقاتل أجنبي مِن سوريا للقتال إلى الجانب الأوكراني! تلمّح الدراسة إلى أنّ تجميع المقاتلين الأجانب في أوكرانيا ليس اعتباطيًا، وكأنها ترى ملفَ «العائدين من أوكرانيا»، عين الإعصار الناشئ!							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286140
286139	2	رؤى جزائرية في التعامل مع ذاكرة الإرهاب (2002-2022) : | التعافي-التدين-الفنون /		يتناول هذا الكتاب المحاولات والمبادرات والممارسات التي تبنتها الجزائر، لإدارة تداعيات العشرية الدموية (1992-2002) وأثرها على الذاكرة الجمعية الجزائرية وكيفية التعاطي مع تبعات الإرهاب على المستويات القانونية والثقافية والتعليمية والنفسية، ويكثف تسليط الضوء على المحاولات المجتمعية والحكومية المشتركة لاستيعاب الصدمة، وتجاوزها عبر مساومات وتفاوضات محددة. وثقت الدراسات خلفية العنف الإسلاموي وغطت انفجاره وناقشت تعامل الجهات الرسمية معه، ولاحظت غياب مسارات الشفاء عن المناهج الدراسية وتغييب المأساة الوطنية، وركزت على سجناء قضايا الإرهاب واستراتيجية مكافحته، وعرضت التدابير القانونية والمبادرات التشريعية المتخذة، ورصدت مساعي تعزيز السلم في المنظومة التربوية، وإعادة بناء مناهج العلوم الشرعية في الجامعات الجزائرية واستكمالا لتقييم مستويات الأمن الروحي درست التدابير الدينية، للقضاء على التطرف. ثقافيا، طرحت المبادرات الثقافية لمكافحة الراديكالية ودور الدراما التلفزيونية والسينمائية الجزائرية. ¦ وثّق الكتاب خلفية العنف الإسلاموي الذي سبق العشرية الدموية، وغطى انفجاره في سنوات الحرب الأهلية، فاحتوى على مسرد لأبرز أحداثها المؤلمة. حاولت فاتحة الدراسات التي قدمها الأكاديمي والباحث الجزائري إسماعيل لاطرش، تمييز ردّ فعل الدولة الردعي والمباشر بعد 1992، قبل أن تتبنى استراتيجية المصالحة والحوار والعفو، وتتويج مبادرات السلم ومعالجة الذاكرة، بقوانين ومبادرات “قانون الرحمة” لسنة 1995 و”قانون الوئام المدني” لسنة 1999 و”ميثاق السلم والمصالحة الوطنية” لسنة 2005، مما أدى -حسب رواية الدراسة- إلى استسلام المتطرفين والنزول من الجبال والمعاقل. ارتبطت هذه المبادرات بمشروعية النظام الجزائري الداخلية والخارجية، فتمكنت من تحقيق تسويات تصالحية، خفّفت من منسوب العنف، قبل أن ينطلق مرة أخرى تحت ستار “تنظيم القاعدة في بلاد المغرب الإسلامي”؛ الذي حاول اغتيال الرئيس عبدالعزيز بوتفليقة سنة 2007، ونظم اعتداء إرهابياً على القاعدة النفطية “تقنتورين” سنة 2013.   تطرق أستاذ علوم التربية والباحث والأكاديمي الجزائري عبدالله لبوز، إلى سياسة الذاكرة الجمعية الجزائرية في التعاطي مع العشرية الدموية، فناقش تعامل الجهات الرسمية مع هذا الملف الحيوي، وركز على غياب مسارات الشفاء عن المناهج الدراسية وتغييب “المأساة الوطنية” عن برامجها بحجة تغليب المصلحة الوطنية، داعًيا إلى تأسيس قيام مادة التاريخ المدرسية “بدورها في استرجاع الذاكرة، وتحويل إرث الحرب إلى دعامة أساسية لبناء مجتمع جزائري أكثر تماسكاً وتكاملاً”، مستعرضًا الظاهرة ومتوقفًا عند التسوية الضمنية بين الضحيّة والإرهابي، ملمحًا إلى مقولات البعض التي نصّت على أنّ “أولئك الذين حاربوا الإرهاب قتلوا، وأن ذكرياتهم تم تهميشها واستبعادها”، مشيرًا إلى أنّ السلطة الجزائرية التي تحدثت باسم الضحية، تبنّت نهجًا تصالحيًا، وسِم بـ”فقدان الذاكرة” وهو يحتاج إلى رؤية جديدة للتصالح ومواجهة الماضي الأليم.   وقريبًا من هذه الإجراءات اهتمت دراسة أستاذ العلوم السياسية، الباحث عبداللطيف بوروبي بالسياسة القطاعية الأمنية العامة في الجزائر، فركّزت على ملف سجناء قضايا الإرهاب، وتدابير تجاوز تداعيات العشرية الدموية. بعد تقدمة عن “المقاربة البراغماتية” التي ولجت في تنظيرات التعامل مع الظاهرة الإرهابية بعد أحداث 11 سبتمبر (أيلول) 2001، تناول الباحث الترتيبات الأمنية الجديدة في الحفاظ على السلم والأمن الدوليين، وأثرها على الجزائر عبر تطوير منظومة القوانين الوقائية، ودورها في تجربة التطرف في السجون.  أما استراتيجية مكافحة الجزائر للإرهاب، بعد العشرية الدموية، فتناولتها الباحثة والأكاديمية الجزائرية عبير شليغم، التي التقطت دراستها بذكاء، بداية الظاهرة الإرهابية في الجزائر، فأرّخت وجودها قبل مسار الانتخابات الشهير عام 1991، إذ أشارت إلى انطلاق العمليات الإرهابية مع “الحركة الإسلامية المسلحة”، التي أسسها مصطفى بويعلي سنة 1982. ثم مرت الدراسة على العنف بعد إيقاف المسار الانتخابي، وانفلات عنف الجبهة الإسلامية للإنقاذ، والجماعات الأخرى، وصولاً إلى الإرهاب المنبثق عن تنظيمات مثل القاعدة وداعش العابرة للأوطان. قدّمت الدراسة السياسات التي اتّبعتها الجزائر بهدف القضاء على الإرهاب ومخلفاته، عبر سياسة المواجهة الردعية، ثم سياسة ومسار السلم والمصالحة الوطنية، التي تخلّقت في عهد الرئيس بوتفليقة، ثم برز في مشروع اليد الممدودة ولم الشمل الذي جاء به الرئيس الحالي عبدالمجيد تبون عام 2022.   حاولت التدابير القانونية، والمبادرات التشريعية، التوجه بعلاج جذور المشكلة، سواء في ضبط الخطاب الديني المستورد من الخارج أو تدبير التنوع، بما يقمع “تفشي الكراهية” ويحارب الخطاب العنصري والجهوي. لذا تناول الأكاديمي والباحث الجزائري في العلوم السياسية والعلاقات الدولية بوحنية قوي، التدابير القانونية الإجرائية لمكافحة الراديكالية، مشيرًا إلى خطوات ورِثت من عهد العشرية الدموية وتسوياتها، والمتمثلة في تشكيل قوى مكافحة الإرهاب، وإجراءات المناصحة وتشجيع المراجعات لفتح مسلك لترك التائبين أسلحتهم والإفادة من العفو الأمني. شرحت الدراسة إجراءات العدالة الانتقالية، بما فيها خطوات الإدماج وإعادة التأهيل، وخُتمت بإبراز التحدّيات الأمنية الإقليمية، وتدابير مواجهة خطاب الكراهية، خصوصًا بعد السابقة في قرية ايمزيزو، التي شهدت حادثة تم تأويلها على أنها سابقة عنصرية، بالإضافة إلى تصاعد التباينات الجهوية، والطائفية.  ولئن غابت المأساة الوطنية، وسردياتها عن المناهج التعليمية الجزائرية، فإنّ السُبل إلى تجاوزها لم تغب، فرصدت دراسة التربوي الجزائري عبدالله صوالح، مساعي تعزيز السلم في المنظومة التربوية، بداية من الوثيقة المرجعية، التي ألحّت على تكوين “ضمير المواطنة“، والتعريف بقيم احترام الآخر والتضامن والتعاون وروح التسامح، والقيم الوجدانية والأخلاقية، والمبادرات التي أفضت إلى دعوات لإصلاح المنظومة التربوية بعد العشرية الدموية. حلل الباحث المناهج التعليمية في المراحل الابتدائية والمتوسطة والثانوية، وقيَّم قدرة المدرسين على استلهام ثوابت المجتمع الجزائري لتعزيز السلم في التعليم قبل الجامعي.  أما المستوى الجامعي، فانصرفت دراسة الأكاديمي والأستاذ الجامعي عبدالرحيم بوقطه، للنظر في إعادة بناء مناهج العلوم الشَّرعيَّة في الجامعات الجزائريَّة بعد العشريَّة الدَّمويَّة. بدأت الدراسة بتمهيد تاريخي، لتغلغل الفكر الإخواني في الجامعات الجزائرية؛ والتيارات المنبثقة منه، التي تقاسمت تبني طروحات سيد قطب أيديولوجيًا، وأدبيات سعيد حوى تنظيميًا، وتأثيرات مالك بن نبي، وثورة الخميني حركيًا، فسيطرت على العمل الطلابي، في ظل صراعات دينية أصلها عرقي، إذ “شكلت الجامعة الجزائرية فضاءً خصبًا للصراعات الفكرية بين الإسلاميين وأصحاب اليسار (البربر والشيوعيون الجزائريون) حول المشاريع والمواثيق المتخذة من طرف السلطة”. نتج عن ذلك تحول استراتيجية الإسلاميين إلى الدخول في السياسة والتشكيك في شرعية الدولة “الاشتراكية”، وساهم صراعهم مع اليسار، في تبني السلطات لكتلة إسلاموية غايتها مقاومة مراكز القوى اليسارية، أفاد منها تيار مالك بن نبي، علمًا أن السلطة –كما يشير الباحث- استعانت عام 1981 برجال دين من خارج الجزائر مثل محمد الغزالي. تناولت الدراسة انعكاسات هذا الواقع في سنوات العشرية الدموية، قبل أن تنطلق إلى توصيف مناهج العلوم الشرعية في جامعة “الأمير عبدالقادر للعلوم الإنسانية” التي اتخذتها نموذجًا، فرأت فيها تقليدًا لمدارس خارج الجزائر، وبيّنت أثر التجاذبات الدعوية والسياسية في رسم مناهج تدريس العلوم الشرعية بالجامعة الجزائرية، وصولاً إلى هيكلة المناهج بعد المأساة الوطنية بما يساهم في تأمين الأمن الروحي الجزائري.  واستكمالاً لتقييم مستويات الأمن الروحي، درس أستاذ التعليم العالي بوزارة التعليم العالي والبحث العلمي في الجزائر عبدالقادر عبد العالي، التدابير الدينية، للقضاء على التطرف بعد العشرية الدموية. ركّزت الدراسة على إصلاحات مجال الشؤون الدينية، الذي حرصت الدولة على ضبطه بحظر التبرع للأعمال الخيرية والجمعيات الدينية خارج المساجد المعتمدة، فجعلت جمع التبرعات وفق رخص ممنوحة من قبل مديرية الشؤون الدينية، لاستعادة الموروث الروحي الجزائري، بإعادة الاعتبار للمدارس القرآنية والزوايا المختصة في تحفيظ القرآن وتلقين متون المذهب المالكي، وتكوين روابط علماء ودعاة لتعزيز السلم، وسط دعوات لتشييد المؤسسة الدينية في الجزائر.  كان دور المؤسسة الدينية في المصالحات الوطنية الجزائرية، محل نظر أستاذة الفلسفة في جامعة معسكر في الجزائر عقون مليكة، وقد سعت للإجابة عن أسئلة رئيسة: إلى أيّ مدى تمكنت المؤسسة الدينية نظرًا إلى تاريخها، من الإسهام في المصالحة الوطنية؟ كيف يمكنها التأثير في المجال الاجتماعي مقابل المرجعيّات الأخرى؟ وهل يمكن للسلطة ادّعاء الهيمنة على المجال الديني مستقبلًا؟ أشارت الباحثة إلى أن التيارات الإسلاموية عملت على تهميش ومحاصرة دور المؤسسات الدينية الجزائرية التقليدية، وصنعت خطابًا حركيًا موازيًا، يقوّض جهود الدولة والإسلام التقليدي، الذي اضّطرت السلطة للتحالف معه لهزيمة التطرف. دعت الدراسة إلى أهمية اعتماد المدونات القانونية الجديدة لدرء الكراهية الدينية وازدراء الأديان والتكفير، على تنظيمات تقليدية أخلاقية، ملزمة باحترام التعددية الدينية. وهو الإطار نفسه الذي بحثت تفصيله دراسة للباحث الجزائري عبدالكريم عشور، الذي تطرّق إلى استغلال الراديكاليين في الجزائر للمؤسسات المسجدية، قبل العشرية الدموية، ملاحظًا أن عودة الزوايا الصوفية والجمعيات الثقافية، المُدعّم بقانون الجمعيات المُعدّل الصادر سنة 2012، أدت إلى محاصرة بيئة الخطاب الراديكالي، وترافق هذا الجهد مع برامج تكوين الأئمة ومُدرّسي القرآن.  ثقافيًا، تناول أستاذ علم الاجتماع فوزي بن دريدي، المبادرات الثقافية لمكافحة الراديكالية. بدأت دراسته برصد وافٍ للمثقفين الجزائريين الذين اغتالتهم أيادي الغدر الإرهابية أثناء العشرية الدموية، من بين هؤلاء: بختي بن عودة (1961-1996)، والطاهر جاووت (1954-1993)، وعبدالقادر علولة (1939-1994)، وعز الدين مجوبي (1945-1995)، ومحمد بوخبزة، والشاب حسني (1968-1994)، ومعطوب الوناس (1956-1998)، وغيرهم، مما أدى لتهجير المثقفين إلى أوروبا. لذا كان إحياء الفعاليات الثقافية هو أول الوسائل لإعادة الاتّزان، وتعويض الفقد الثقافي، بمبادرات تدعمها الدولة، فرصد الباحث الموازنات المالية الداعمة للثقافة بين عامي (2002-2022).  كشفت دراسة أستاذ التعليم العالي في علوم الإعلام والاتصال زكرياء بن صغير عن دور الدراما التلفزيونية والسينمائية الجزائرية في مكافحة التّطرف وعلاج رواسب المأساة الوطنية بين عامي (2002-2022)، فعرّفت بأهم القيم الإيجابية والسلبية التي تمت معالجتها خلال المشاهد الدرامية لمجموعة من الأفلام والمسلسلات، ولاحظت غياب استراتيجية إعلامية يمكن الاعتماد عليها في ترشيد السيناريوهات والمشاهد الدرامية، التي جعلت جل الأفلام والمسلسلات، مبادرات فردية منعزلة عن السياق العام للسياسة الإعلامية الرسمية. كل ذلك لم يمنع وجود عدد من الأعمال الدرامية التي تركت تأثيرًا إيجابيًا في تعزيز المسؤولية الاجتماعية والأخلاقية والوطنية، مثل: “أولاد الحلال”، و”عين الجنة”، و”أنين الأرض”، و”دقيوس ومقيوس”، و”قلوب تحت الرماد”، و”معاناة امرأة”، و”اللاعب”، وغيرها من أعمال ساهمت في تعزيز المسؤولية الاجتماعية التي تقوم على البعد الوظيفي، والبعد الأخلاقي، والبعد القيمي المهني، والتي تؤدي إلى نبذ التطرف والتعصب. وركّز البحث على الأعمال الدرامية التي تناولت المأساة الجزائرية الوطنية، مثل: فيلم رشيدة، وفيلم المنارة، وفيلم المحنة، وفيلم التائب، وفيلم عطور الجزائر، وأبواب الشمس.. الجزائر إلى الأبد.  قدّم الباحث المغربي في الحركات الإسلامية منتصر حمادة، دراسة العدد، حول تأثير أعمال أحمد بن

286138	2	تقييم برامج نزع الراديكالية و إزالة التطرف : | المبادرات الأهلية و الرسمية /		يتناول هذا الكتاب مناهج وبرامج مكافحة التطرف ونزع الراديكالية في أميركا والهند وإندونيسيا والمغرب ولبنان وغيرها من الدول، فيدرس الإطار المفاهيمي لممارسات نزع التطرف، وبرامجها، ويتطرق إلى جدوى تعاون المتطرفين السابقين في مشاريع مكافحة الإرهاب ونزع التطرفية، ودور منظمات المجتمع المدني وتأمين قنوات حوار نفسية وفكرية. قيمت الدراسات التي ساهم فيها خبراء صناعة برامج نزع التطرف البرامج المتباينة لدى عدد من الدول، وانتهت إلى أهمية مشاركة المرجعيات العلمية النفسية والدينية في هذه البرامج وضرورة إنشاء رابطة تعاونية بين أجهزة الدول المختلفة، وإشراك المجتمع فيها، واهتمت بالمدربين المناصحين، وفئات الموقوفين، مع التركيز على النساء. ¦ بدأ الكتاب، بدراسةٍ وضّحت الإطار المفاهيمي لممارسات نزع التطرف، لخّصت فيه أبرز استراتيجيات إعادة التأهيل، وعرضت الدروس المستفادة من برامج وممارسات نزع التّطرف، مع التركيز على مسألة المقاتلين الأجانب المُلِحّة، وطرق التّعامل معهم، وقيّمت مبدأ إعادة الإدماج نفسه، وتبيين مخاطر انتكاس التائبين من التّطرف والراديكالية، بناءً على دراسات إحصائية، أكّدت أن العودة إلى التطرف واردة، لكنها مرتبطة بالبرامج نفسها، وارتباطها بالرّكائز النفسيّة والاجتماعيّة، وإدراك العمق المجتمعي، ومساهمة فريق مُتخصّص في إعادة التأهيل الدّيني في عمليّات الإدماج، فنجاح البرامج يبدأ من لحظة الإعداد لها، بجرد الظّروف التي تكون المجتمعات بموجبها مستعدّة لقبول «السابقين»، والجهود المتطلّبة منهم. وزعمت الدّراسة أن المرونة القضائيّة مهمة، لاستيعاب حلٍّ يمكن أن يُحاكي «العدالة الانتقالية» لتلافي التعقيدات القانونية! كما زعمت أن استخدام ألفاظ تنفي الوصمة عن «المتطرف السابق» يسهم في تقبل المجتمع له، لتسكينه في خانة طبيعية، فالاستراتيجيات يجب أن تصمم خصيصًا لاحتياجات المجتمع ووجهات نظره، وقدرته على استيعاب العائدين أو نبذهم.  في أنموذجٍ حديث، لصناعة مشاريع مرتبطة بالمجتمع، ووقايته من معزّزات الراديكالية والتطرف، اختبرت دراسة صناعة الرّواية المضادة لكسر الهُويّة الإعلامية التي ترسخها المنظّمات المتطرّفة، فأخذت مكافحة داعش أنموذجًا، وتفحّصت نماذج في جملة من البلدان، منها: جمهورية ترينيداد وتوباغو (Republic of Trinidad and Tobago). بينما سردت دراسة سيرة (270) منشقًّا وعائدًا وسجينًا، انتموا سابقًا لداعش، فحدّدت المسارات التي اتّبعوها لدخول التنظيم والخروج منه. وبعد ذلك ناقشت استراتيجية ونتائج مشروع الوقاية من التّطرف على الإنترنت، بنشر مقاطع فيديو لرواية مضادّة تظهر أعضاء في داعش، يتحدّثون صراحة ضدّ التنظيم على الفيسبوك ومنصات التواصل الاجتماعي الأخرى.  بحثت دراسة ميدانية في جدوى تعاون التائبين عن التّطرف والإرهاب، والمتراجعين عنه، ودور منظّمات المجتمع المدني، فقيّمت دور مؤسسة «آباء من أجل السلام» (Parents for Peace)، الأهلية، التي انطلقت فكرتها من أُسر متطرفين «سابقين»؛ أرادوا تعزيز الوقاية من التّطرف. بدأت الدّراسة بتقييم فكرة انخراط متورطين سابقين في جهود مكافحة فعلٍ وفكرٍ اعتنقوه سابقًا، ورصدت المحاذير الأوليّة المفترضة، ثم توقفت عند المكاسب الكبيرة، والمصداقيّة التي تكتسبها جهودهم، خصوصًا عند الحوار مع إرهابيين ومتطرفين حاليين مُدانين. على الرّغم من تأكيدها «أن بعض المتطرّفين السّابقين المنخرطين، لم يُظهروا مؤشّرات على الخروج من الراديكالية، على الرغم من ادّعائهم أنهم لا يرون اللجوء إلى العنف أمرًا مبررًا». تميّزت مؤسسة «آباء من أجل السلام» بتقديم تعريف واسع للتّطرف يشمل عناصر تورطت في أيديولوجية يمينية تفوّقية، وأخرى ارتبطت بتنظيم داعش. تعمل المؤسسة مع أجهزة قوى إنفاذ القانون الأميركية، في عدد من السجون منذ عام 2016، وطوّرت بروتوكولات للتّدخل، تشمل السّجن، وفضاء الحياة العامة، وبعض التّصرّفات التي تزيد من فرص، نزع التّطرف عن الأفراد المدانين الراغبين.  أما البرامج الحكوميّة، المباشرة، التي توظف متدرّبين مباشرين، شاركوا في تأهيل الإرهابيين، ومساعدتهم للخروج من التطرف، فتبرز التّجربة الإندونيسيّة في مقدمة المحاولات المميّزة، لذا فصّلت دراسة في صفات المدرّبين المشاركين في هذه البرامج. وخلال تفصيلها، تطرقت إلى تقييم نزع التطرفيّة ذاته، والفرق بينه وبين فكّ الارتباط، من حيث التفريق بين تغيير منظومة الإيمان بالتّطرف، وتغيير السلوك العلني، بالاستجابة للمغريات أو المناصحة، مبيّنة نظريات علم النفس الاجتماعي التّطبيقي، حول تغيير الهوية بسبب فترة الامتثال الذرائعي؛ المدفوع بالثواب والعقاب، والانتباه للتّنافر المعرفي؛ وتحفيز التبرير المنطقي، وصولاً إلى الحوار الداخلي المحفّز لقبول معتقدات جديدة. لذا حرص النموذج الإندونيسي على توفير عُدَّة دينية، تُحفّز التّحول الأيديولوجي. خلصت الدراسة إلى أهمية المراجعة الأيديولوجيّة، واقترحت أن يُقدّم لحوار المتطرفين أشخاص قادرون على إظهار النزاهة، وكسب ثقة الجناة، والتواضع، والاعتدال، والأصالة الدينية، وتقدير الإنسانية، واتساع الحيلة، وفهم اللغة العربية، والنأي عن الدخول في وعود للمتطرفين.  تُسلّط دراسة الضوء على ظاهرة التّطرّف المرتبط بداعش في الهند، مع التركيز على الجهود الاستباقية. فتطرّقت إلى حالة ولاية ماهاراشترا (Maharashtra)، التي بدأت منذ عام 2016، برنامجًا لنزع التّطرف، باتباع نهجٍ مرنٍ يتكون من برامج صغيرة تستهدف الأفراد والمجتمعات، نجحت عبره في إعادة إدماج (114) رجلاً وست نساء. وانتهت الدّراسة إلى تقديم عدد من المقترحات أهمها: الاعتماد على الأصالة التقليدية للإسلام التقليدي الهندي، لمواجهة النّزعات التّطرّفية الوافدة، المرتبطة بالتوظيف السّياسي.  في الدول العربية، يبرز الأنموذج المصري في نزع التّطرف، فتناولته دراسة تَتَبّعت فيه مراجعات الجماعة الإسلامية وبرامج مواجهة تطرف جماعة الإخوان وداعش، وركّزت على التحولات في الاستراتيجية المصرية في مكافحة الإرهاب، وظروفها. قيّمت الدراسة حالة المراجعات الإسلامويّة وجديّتها، ونجاحها الإجرائي، وحاولت الإجابة عن الأسئلة التي أبرزتها عودة تائبين إلى العنف بعد ثورة 30 يونيو (حزيران)، التي أسقطت حكم جماعة الإخوان. نَبّهت الدّراسة إلى أنّ تجربة المراجعات نبعت من أهمية تفكيك الأفكار المغلوطة المفخخة التي ترسّخت لدى الإرهابيين حول قضايا العنف والتكفير، في التسعينيات من القرن المنصرم، بيد أن المبادرات الجديدة مرتبطة بتحديات أمنيّة وضرورات عملياتيّة، تأثرت المرحلة الأولى منها بتجربة المناصحة الدّينيّة التي تقودها التّجربة السّعوديّة، فانبرى رجال الدين المصريون في تعرية الأفكار؛ أما المرحلة الثانية فهي التقييمات الأمنيّة، أما المرحلة الثالثة فتستجيب للتقييم النفسي الذي يفرضه الأطباء النّفسيون. نبّهت الدّارسة إلى أن البرنامج المصري لنزع التّطرف، قيد التّشكل، وسيكون في داخله مبادرات فرديّة وجماعيّة متنوّعة، تمثّل أرضيّةً مفيدةً للتجارب العربية الرسمية والأهلية.  مثّلت ظاهرة العائدين من داعش مسألةً جوهريةً في تونس، لذا قيّمت دراسة جاهزيّة مؤسسات الدّولة المتمثّلة في اللّجنة الوطنيّة لمكافحة الإرهاب، والمؤسّسات الأمنيّة والقضائيّة، بالإضافة إلى وزارة الشؤون الدّينيّة، وعرضت «مبادرة تواصل» للحماية والوقاية من التّطرف في السّجون، كما ركّزت على التعامل مع الوضعيّات الخاصّة، للأطفال واليافعين، خصوصًا المحتجزين إلى الآن في مخيمي الهول والروج شمال شرق سوريا. اقترحت الدّراسة فهم تنوّع الأدوار والدّوافع المختلفة في مجموعة العائدين (المحتملة) من بؤر التّوتر باعتبارها شرطًا أساسيًا لتقدير التّحدّيات والمخاطر التي قد يمثّلونها.  مثَّل برنامج «مصالحة» المغربي، أحد أهم البرامج المختصّة في نزع الّتطرف على المستوى الأفريقي، لذا شرحت دراسة السّياقات والعوامل التي دفعت إلى تبنّيه؛ خصوصًا تدبير ظاهرة العائدين من مناطق الصراع في سوريا والعراق. وبوصف البرنامج امتداداً لفك الارتباط الأمني داخل السجون، تعمل فيه مجموعة من المؤسسات، تشترك فيه الرابطة المحمدية للعلماء، ومؤسسة محمد السادس لإعادة إدماج السجناء، وغيرهما. تحلَّل الدراسة محاور وتقنيات الاشتغال من خلال شروط الإفادة والفاعلين والموارد المرصودة، وتقيِّم البرنامج ونتائج إعادة إدماج المُستفيدين، الذين تصنّفهم اجتماعيًا ومهنيًا وتعليميًا. لاحظت الدّراسة أنّ (1531) متطرفًا، لم يكن من بينهم سوى أربعة أئمة! لتؤكد أنّ الثّقافة الدّينية الوافدة؛ أقوى من المكتسبة تقليديًا. تتأسس الدّراسة منهجيًا على توظيف البيانات والمُعطيات الإحصائيّة الرسميّة، فترصد أعداد المُستفيدين من البرامج والحاصلين على العفو الملكي في المغرب ومُعدلات الارتداد والنكوص. كما تُناقش التقارير السّنوية الصادرة عن المندوبيّة العامّة لإدارة السّجون والبرلمان، وكذلك البلاغات والمصادر المفتوحة والقوانين.  احتوى الكتاب على شهادة كتبها أحد أبرز المؤثّرين سابقًا في صناعة مشهد «التّطرف» في المغرب والسّجون المغربيّة، قبل أن يُعلن تراجعه، ويخرج من السّجن. قدّم فيها تقييمًا للمراجعات الفرديّة والجماعية الأخرى.  تلقي دراسة ميدانيّة الضوء على فرضيّة تأثير النّظام الأبوي في النساء ودفعهن للتّطرف، وذلك عبر إجراء مقابلات واستبيانات للمدانين مع التّركيز على النساء، في سجني روميّة وبربر الخازن في لبنان. قسّمت الدّراسة النساء إلى ثلاث مجموعات: الدّاعمات بشكل كامل للأفكار والمعتقدات التّطرّفيّة؛ والدّاعمات للمتطرّفين بسبب الرّوابط العائلية دون دعم للأفكار؛ وضحايا المجاميع التّطرّفيّة. نقضت الدّراسة حصر دوافع التّطرف في الفقر والتّدين، وذكرت نماذج لنجاح تجارب إعادة التّأهيل، والآليات التي اتّبعتها لتحقيق هذه النّتائج الإيجابيّة مع تقديم مقترحات.  وفي الحالة اليمنيّة تطرّقت دراسة إلى التّحدّيات التي تحول دون التّنفيذ الأمثل لعملية إدماج الجماعات المسلحة في اليمن بعد الصراع؛ مستشهدة بالحالة الكولومبية والبنود والآليات الواضحة التي وردت في اتّفاقية السّلام، التي أنهت خمسين عامًا من الصّراع، مقابل خلو بعض اتفاقيات السّلام اليمنيّة السّبع منها، وعدم وجود رؤية وقدرة لتنفيذها في الاتّفاقيات التي ذكرت في دراستها، عبر قراءة لهذه الاتّفاقيات منذ اتفاقية الوحدة عام 1990، وصولاً لإعلان نقل السّلطة في أبريل (نيسان) 2022، وأخيراً التّحدّيات التي تواجهها عمليّة إدماج الجماعات المسلّحة في اليمن.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286138

286136	2	الصراع على البصرة : | تشابك السياسة و النفط و المصالح الإقليمية في محافظة العراق الجنوبية /		البصرة هي مَنفذ العراق الوحيد على الخليج العربي، وفيها تقع معظم ثروته النفطية، ولموقعها الجغرافي أهمية كبيرة، بسبب حدودها الطويلة مع إيران، وإطلالتها على مياه الخليج، ومجاورتها لدولة الكويت وقربها من المملكة العربية السعودية. وأصبحت البصرة مساحةً خطيرة للصراع على السلطة والموارد بين القوى السياسية العراقية بعد سقوط نظام صدام حسين عام 2003، ومنطلقاً لموجات الاحتجاج الجماهيرية، فضلاً عن تحولها إلى مقصد للهجرات من المدن الجنوبية الأخرى. ولا يُمكن التفكير بمستقبل العراق ومآلات الأوضاع فيه من دون التفكير بالبصرة وظروفها، والتحولات التي شهدتها، ومستقبلها.  يسعى هذا الإصدار، الذي شارك في إعداده مجموعة من الخبراء والباحثين العراقيين، إلى تقديم فهم أعمق وأوسع لأوضاع محافظة البصرة، والاجابة عن أسئلة رئيسة مثل: ما طبيعة الخريطة السياسية وتحولاتها في البصرة خلال العقدين الأخيرين؟ وكيف تحول نفط البصرة إلى معضلة للاقتصاد السياسي العراقي؟ وما طبيعة العلاقة بين العشيرة والسياسة والاقتصاد في البصرة؟ وكيف نفهم الأبعاد المحلية لمطالب الفيدرالية أو الحكم الذاتي في هذه المحافظة؟ وما الديناميات المشكِّلة للنفوذ الإيراني في البصرة وتداعياته على المحيط الإقليمي؟							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286136

286128	2	نموذج دولة الإمارات في بناء القوة : | رؤية محمد بن زايد /	الكتبي، إبتسام،	على مدى العقود الثلاثة الماضية، صاغ الشيخ محمد بن زايد آل نهيان وقاد أبرز السياسات الإماراتية في الدفاع والسياسة الخارجية والأمن والتعليم والاقتصاد والثقافة، ما يجعل من الصعب الحديث عن نموذج دولة الإمارات في بناء القوة الشاملة ومقاربة تحولات سياساتها الخارجية من دون شرح الدور المحوري الذي يمثله الشيخ محمد بن زايد في ذلك كلّه، فهو صاحب رؤية ويحمل مشروعاً للتحديث والازدهار والريادة.  هذا الكتاب يَصدُر عقب تَولّي الشيخ محمد بن زايد رئاسة دولة الإمارات، مُسلّطاً الضوء على المبادرات الكبرى التي قادها على مدى الحقبة الماضية، وعلى مشروعه لإمارات المستقبل خلال الخمسين عاماً المقبلة، وهي "وَصفَة" أسس لها الشيخ محمد بن زايد من خلال رؤيته "مئوية الاتحاد"، مؤكّداً ما يقوله المراقبون عن الإمارات بأن "المستقبل فيها يبدأ من الحاضر".  إنّ المواءمة المرنة، التي صاغها الشيخ محمد بن زايد، بين السياستين الداخلية والخارجية، قادت البلاد باتجاه هُوية سياسية أكثر تعددية وثراءً. صارت استراتيجيات بناء الذات وتنويع مصادر الدخل ومصادر التسلح، وتنويع الشراكات الإقليمية والدولية، والاستثمارات الخارجية، وتنويع المحتوى التعليمي والديني، والاستثمار في التكنولوجيا والتحوّل الرقمي والاستدامة... دعائم سياسية لواقع جديد يقود إلى مستقبل إماراتي مختلف؛ وتبدو فيه عناصر القوة الشاملة في نموذج الإمارات أكثر متانة وتنافسية من ذي قبل.  وإذْ يُسلّط الكتابُ الضَّوءَ على عوامل ومؤشرات تحوّل دولة الإمارات إلى قوة إقليمية فاعلة، فإنه يُقدّم قراءة منهجية متماسكة للتحولات والإصلاحات الاستباقية التي اتخذتها الإمارات استعداداً لحقبة ما بعد النفط؛ وفي سياق التخطيط لمرحلة ما بعد مرور 50 عاماً على تأسيسها وقيام اتحادها.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286128
286127	2	تحقيق العدالة الجنائية الدولية : | دراسة في نطاق القضاء الوطني /	الزبير، محمد عدنان علي،	كتاب تحقيق العدالة الجنائية الدولية: دراسة في نطاق القضاء الوطني لمحمد عدنان علي الزبر. يقع الكتاب في 376 صفحة، ويشتمل على ببليوغرافية وفهرس عام."إن العدالة الجنائية الدولية ليست مطلقة كعادتها"، فقد عجزت عن تلبية الطموح الإنساني وإنصاف المستضعفين في الأرض وجبر ضرر الضحايا ومعاقبة المتهمين بارتكاب جرائم دولية في كثير من الأحيان. وعلى الرغم من ذلك، فإن القضاءين الوطني والدولي ما زالا يساهمان في تحقيق العدالة المذكورة كلما سنحت الفرصة وفرضت الإرادة الإنسانية كلمتها. إن معظم الأدبيات القانونية انشغلت في البحث والدراسة والحديث عن دور القضاء الدولي وحده في تحقيق العدالة الجنائية الدولية، حتى ساد مفهوم التلازم بين القانون الجنائي الدولي والقضاء الدولي، وانعكس بشكل كبير على مفهوم العدالة، كما غفلت هذه الأدبيات أو تغافلت عن دراسة دور القضاء الوطني في هذا الشأن، لذلك تحاول هذه الدراسة إعادة صوغ مفهوم العدالة بتعريفها وذكر خصائصها، ودراسة نطاقيها الشخصي والموضوعي، وتأكيد الدور الذي يمارسه القضاء الوطني في تحقيقها تطبيقًا وتعزيزًا.ما العدالة الجنائية الدولية؟ليس في الإمكان تطبيق العدالة الجنائية الدولية ما لم تتوافر مقوماتها ويقوم على تنظيمها وتطبيقها قانونيًّا قضاءٌ مختص، إلا أن ضرورة توافر هذه المقومات والتلازم الحتمي بين القانون والقضاء والعدالة والتأثير المتبادل بينهم، لا يعني الاندماج إلى درجة الانصهار وفقدان أحد المقومات وجوده بصفته كيانًا مستقلًّا في حال غياب الآخر، ثم إن غياب القضاء لا يعني عدم وجود القاعدة القانونية المنظِّمة للعدالة وإلزاميتها، بل إن غياب القانون والقضاء معًا لا يعني غياب فكرة العدالة السائدة في ضمائر الناس، وإنْ تجاهَلَ المُشرِّع "الدولي" اعتمادها فترة من الزمن في قواعد قانونية ملزمة، وخصّها بالقضاء المعنيّ بتطبيقها، على الرغم من أن ردات فعل أفراد المجتمع واستياءهم نتيجة عدم مواكبة المُشرِّع الفكرةَ القانونية الجديدة السائدة في المجتمع المتعلقة بمفهوم العدالة، ستُلزم المُشرِّع مواكبتها عاجلًا أم آجلًا، وإلّا كان مصيره العُزلة عمَّن يحكمهم، ومن ثم فقدان الشرعية أو زعزعتها على أقل تقدير. لكن المُشرَّع يُبادر في بعض الأحيان إلى صوغ فكرة العدالة وتنظيم أحكامها من دون أن تكون لها سابقة، أو يَسعى إلى تطويرها تبعًا للظروف التي دفعته إلى ذلك، فيفرضها بقواعد قانونية ملزمة، اتفاقيةً كانت أو عُرفية.ويترتب على ما تَقدم أمران؛ الأول يتعلّق بنشأة العدالة الجنائية الدولية ووجودها، والآخر يتعلّق بمفهومها. فعلى مستوى النشأة والوجود، فإن فكرة العدالة الجنائية الدولية سابقة لوجود القانون المعنيّ بها في حالة تراخي المُشرِّع الدولي في تنظيمها. وتؤكد الأدبيات القانونية أن فكرة العدالة الجنائية الدولية لم تكن وليدة اليوم أو الأمس القريب، وإنما أسهمت الحضارات الإنسانية على اختلاف أزمنتها في تزويد روافد العدالة الجنائية الدولية بالشعور الإنساني والأفكار المتطلعة لتحقيقها، حتى تعالت الأصوات المطالِبة بتقنين مبادئها وأحكامها ومحاكمة المعتدين عليها.وكذلك الحال بالنسبة إلى القانون الجنائي الدولي، فإن القضاء لا يُعَدّ جزءًا من ماهيته، وإنما يُعَدّ عاملًا في تطبيقه، ومن ثم مستقلًا عنه؛ فالقاعدة القانونية الجنائية الدولية موجودة وملزمة، وإن غاب القضاء الدولي المعنيّ بتطبيقها.وبذلك، فإن القاعدة القانونية الجنائية الدولية سابقة - من حيث نشأتها - لواقعة التأسيس لقضاء دولي بغية النظر في بعض الجرائم الدولية، وهو المتمثل في محكمتي نورمبرغ وطوكيو، وإن ساهمت هاتان المحكمتان في تطوير القانون المذكور وتعديل أحكامه بفضل نظامَيهما الأساسيَين، بعدِّ تلك القاعدة جزءًا من المنظومة القانونية الجنائية الدولية والتفسير الذي اعتمده قضاتها.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286127

286007	3	The Emirati approach to sustainability and climate action /		This book explores the roots of sustainable development and climate action within Emirati thought. It begins by outlining early features of sustainability in the cultural and historical heritage of Emirati society. It then traces five key stages in the evolution of the concept of sustainable development in the UAE; from the first phase in 1972, until the last, extending from 2000 to the present day. Contributing factors from the UAE’s history and heritage are reviewed to demonstrate a strong culture of sustainable thought, in both economic and social practices. Empirical data is then presented to chart the UAE’s successes in balancing the legislative and practical aspects of sustainable development and climate protection. The book details the UAE’s sustainable development strategies, before going on to explore the UAE’s increased contributions to international efforts to minimize the impacts of climate change and promote a green economy. Central are investments in clean and sustainable energy sources worldwide. Lastly, the book documents the UAE’s approach, over the course of the last decade, to increase investment in clean energy sources and maintain climate neutrality commitments. Regionally, the UAE has taken the lead in this area, as evidenced by the goals of the UAE Net Zero 2050 strategic initiative. This comprehensive narrative of the historic and cultural roots of sustainability in Emirati thought offers a deeper understanding of UAE climate action, and provides a valuable resource that could serve to enrich other countries’ experiences in addressing the climate challenge.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286007

285801	1	Leadership : | Six Studies in World Strategy.	Kissinger, Henry.	An instant New York Times bestseller Henry Kissinger, consummate diplomat and statesman, examines the strategies of six great twentieth-century figures and brings to life a unifying theory of leadership and diplomacy "An extraordinary book, one that braids together two through lines in the long and distinguished career of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger...In Leadership he presents a fascinating set of historical case studies and political biographies that blend the dance and the dancer, seamlessly." - James Stavridis, The Wall Street Journal"Leaders," writes Henry Kissinger in this compelling book, "think and act at the intersection of two axes: the first, between the past and the future; the second, between the abiding values and aspirations of those they lead. They must balance what they know, which is necessarily drawn from the past, with what they intuit about the future, which is inherently conjectural and uncertain. It is this intuitive grasp of direction that enables leaders to set objectives and lay down a strategy."   In Leadership, Kissinger analyses the lives of six extraordinary leaders through the distinctive strategies of statecraft, which he believes they embodied. After the Second World War, Konrad Adenauer brought defeated and morally bankrupt Germany back into the community of nations by what Kissinger calls "the strategy of humility." Charles de Gaulle set France beside the victorious Allies and renewed its historic grandeur by "the strategy of will." During the Cold War, Richard Nixon gave geostrategic advantage to the United States by "the strategy of equilibrium." After twenty-five years of conflict, Anwar Sadat brought a vision of peace to the Middle East by a "strategy of transcendence." Against the odds, Lee Kuan Yew created a powerhouse city-state, Singapore, by "the strategy of excellence." And, though Britain was known as "the sick man of Europe" when Margaret Thatcher came to power, she renewed her country's morale and international position by "the strategy of conviction."   To each of these studies, Kissinger brings historical perception, public experience and--because he knew each of the subjects and participated in many of the events he describes--personal knowledge.

285782	1	AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning : | A Security Perspective /		"Today Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL) have become the hottest areas in the information technology. In our society, there are so many intelligent devices that rely on AI/ML/DL algorithms/tools for smart operations. Although AI/ML/DL algorithms/tools have used in many Internet applications and electronic devices, they are also vulnerable to various attacks and threats. The AI parameters may be distorted by the internal attacker; the DL input samples may be polluted by adversaries; the ML model may be misled by changing the classification boundary, and many other attacks/threats. Those attacks make the AI products dangerous to use. While the above discussion focuses on the security issues in AI/ML/DL-based systems (i.e., securing the intelligent systems themselves), AI/ML/DL models/algorithms can be used for cyber security (i.e., use AI to achieve security). Since the AI/ML/DL security is a new emergent field, many researchers and industry people cannot obtain detailed, comprehensive understanding of this area. This book aims to provide a complete picture on the challenges and solutions to the security issues in various applications. It explains how different attacks can occur in advanced AI tools and the challenges of overcoming those attacks. Then many sets of promising solutions are described to achieve AI security and privacy in this book. The features of this book consist of 7 aspects: This is the first book to explain various practical attacks and countermeasures to AI systems; Both quantitative math models and practical security implementations are provided; It covers both "securing the AI system itself" and "use AI to achieve security"; It covers all the advanced AI attacks and threats with detailed attack models; It provides the multiple solution spaces to the security and privacy issues in AI tools; The differences among ML and DL security/privacy issues are explained.

285778	1	The bounds of defense : | killing, moral responsibility, and war /	Strawser, Bradley Jay,	Most people believe that killing someone, while generally morally wrong, can in some cases be a permissible act. Most people similarly believe that war, while awful, can be justified. Bradley Jay Strawser examines a set of related moral issues in war: when it is permissible to kill in defense of others; what moral responsibility would be required to be liable for such defensive killing; how that permission can extend to whole groups of people; and, lastly, what values undergird the permissibility of that defense, such as individual autonomy. Strawser argues for a rights-based account of permissible defensive harm and an 'evidence-relative' basis for the holding those responsible. His view is that in order to be properly responsible for an unjust harm to be justifiably killed, one must act wrongly according to the evidence available to them.Extending this view, Strawser explores how such a rights-based model can make sense of the wide-spread destructive harms of war. He endorses a revisionist approach to just war theory and argues in its defense; and he also shows how his evidence-relative account supports revisionist just war theory by better grounding it in the real world of modern warfare. Lastly, he offers a new proposal for how targeting in war could better align with respect for the rights of individual persons, and demonstrate how revisionist just war theory-and any rights-respecting just war account more broadly-could conceivably work in practical ways.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285778
285777	1	Skills, creativity and innovation in the digital platform era : | analyzing the new reality of professions and entrepreneurship /	Poutanen, Seppo,	Skills, Creativity and Innovation in the Digital Platform Era: Analyzing the New Reality of Professions and Entrepreneurship brings together two important areas: the separate research topics of professions, platforms, and entrepreneurship, and the various dimensions of what platformization means to work and to professions in contemporary societies. One of the most noteworthy global aspects in current societies is the intensifying presence of technology, to the extent that we can talk about the omnipotence of technologies, a kind of technological imperative that prevails in societies. This new type of technological imperative emerges in the working lives of practicing professionals from medical doctors to lawyers and from teachers to preachers. Platforms have become a powerful actor as enablers and reorganizers of work, creating new types of inequalities but also expanding the market relations for new professions such as social influencers. How do platforms govern and shape work and lead to new questions concerning organizing of work and professions? These are few of the key questions Poutanen and Kovalainen explore in this profound and insightful book.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285777

285773	1	Militias, states and violence against civilians : | civic vice, civic virtue /		"This book examines the conditions under which the presence and use of militias result in an increase or decrease in violence against civilians in intra-state conflicts. Showcasing the breadth and diversity of modern militias in the context of violence against civilians, the volume addresses the predation and repression that many such groups are infamous for, as well as increasingly important efforts by other militias at civilian protection in war-torn settings. The chapters examine militias from around the world, drawing on both qualitative and quantitative methods as they cover groups as varied as gangs, death squads. grassroots community-defense groups, official state militias, and party-sponsored armies -- groups on the "civic vice" side, the "civic virtue" side, and the wide and mixed in-between space where most cases fall. Taken as a cohesive unit, the work lays the foundation for an encompassing theory and interrogation of the causal chain between militia type and operating context and the levels of violence against civilians. It provides path-breaking theory-building and empirical scholarship. Policymakers and national-security practitioners dealing with issues relating to armed groups will also benefit from the practical issues covered here, such as how different forms of sponsorship and training affect militia behavior. This book will be of interest to students of civil wars, political violence, counterinsurgency, civil-military relations, and security studies in general"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285773

285771	1	Global climate change and environmental refugees : | nature, framework and legality /	Singh, Pardeep,	This book explores the possibilities of understanding the concept of climate refugees in order to ascribe to a consensual agreement that climate refugees are evident and this situation is a reality. A framework to study both empirically and theoretically is presented in a detailed manner so that it may become a resource for understanding the challenges of climate refugees. Through discussion and analysis the book presents potential answers to such questions as: ● Why has the international system been so short-sighted and has not given importance to the problems of climate migrants and refugees? ● How to identify a climate refugee? ● How do you justify a climate refugee or a migrant? ● What are internally displaced people? Should we call them just refugees? The book covers the interdisciplinary nature of climate refugees and the perspectives of social science. The empirical findings provides an edge to holistically understanding climate refugees. This book discusses the concept of, what really is a climate refugee, and the necessary factors to make it an important part of the climate discourse. The legality of the term is missing in international parlance, and the academic discourse should provide the necessary critique required for the evolution of the subject under study. Therefore, the major objective of the book is to make the subject of climate migration known to all.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285771

285769	1	Overlapping Regional Orders in the Middle East and North Africa : | Norms and Social Practices of Foreign Behaviour /	Quero, Jordi.	Focused on a set of overlapping international orders of regional scope present in the Middle East and North Africa, this book argues that rules and primary institutions have sanctioned the foreign behavior of the sub-system's international actors since 1945.The author avoids recent IR trends focused on narrow case studies, instead providing a comprehensive overview of the MENA's regional politics. The normative content and evolution of multiple international orders are examined, constituting the intra-Arab order, the Arab-Israeli order and the Arab-Iranian order, as well as the expression of the global order in regional interactions. Drawing on Area Studies and English School and constructivist IR theories, the author argues that a plurality of overlapping regional orders have coexisted since 1945, not just one as is commonly suggested in the literature. Each of these orders is integrated by different participants and has developed its own differentiated norms and institutions setting parameters on legitimate behavior. This analytical proposal helps make sense of foreign relations otherwise labeled as incoherent.The book has wide appeal, accessible both to students wishing to learn about the politics, history and sociology of the Middle East, as well as to specialists seeking original research on the functioning of the MENA's regional orders.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285769

285765	1	The Arms Race in the Middle East : | Contemporary Security Dynamics /	Eslami, Mohammad.	This edited volume discusses security policy and strategic policymaking in the Middle East region. Due to its unique geopolitical, geoeconomic and geostrategic features, the Middle East region has been confronted with challenging security issues. Combined with a lack of an efficient regional security regime this has led to the formation of a full-fledged arms race. This book draws together contributions from international experts to address the factors that have been contributing to the ongoing formation of an arms race in the Middle East as well as the impact of this phenomenon on the regional and global security environment. The book is organized in three sections. The first section outlines the contemporary dynamics of the arms race in the Middle East by focusing on its most recent dynamics and their implications for regional and international security. The second section conducts systematic analysis of case studies of country-specific drivers of the arms race. The third and final section examines the role of external actors in the arms race, evaluating both the responses of regional actors to external interventions as well as the implications of the arms race for extra-regional countries.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285765

285760	1	Deep Loyalties : | Values in Military Lives /	Wortmeyer, Daniela Schmitz.	"Cultural practices and artifacts, in their multiple and varied forms, are grounded on values, which are so deeply internalized by people that usually remain in the background, as taken-for-granted guides for interpretations and decisions in everyday life. Shaping individual moral horizons is at the core of socialization processes, through which older generations aim to disseminate their culturally established values to the new ones, making use of suggestions mainly implicit in daily experiences and interactions. Despite the strength of these processes of cultural canalization, people find particular ways of positioning and interpreting social suggestions, drawing singular life trajectories and developing themselves as unique beings. This is truthful also in case of highly institutionalized settings like the military, in which people play in many forms an agentic role in their own development, being prepared to perform their professional duties in very complex and challenging activity contexts. This book is an invitation to dive deeper into human experiences lived in the military through qualitative and in-depth approaches, observing their affective qualities, the meanings they acquire and how they shape individuals' identities, fostering the development and try-out of specific ethical and moral values. The present work can contribute to research and professional practice in fields related to human development, social processes, education and people management in the military, as well as in other institutional contexts, especially by highlighting the affective, meaningful and moral-ethical dimensions of cultural experiences"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285760

285758	1	Quantum Supremacy : | How the Quantum Computer Revolution Will Change Everything /	Kaku, Michio.	"An exhilarating tour of humanity's next great technological achievement-quantum computing-which may eventually unravel the deepest mysteries of science and solve some of humanity's biggest problems, like global warming, world hunger, and incurable disease, by the bestselling author of The God Equation. The runaway success of the microchip processor may be reaching its end. Running up against the physical constraints of smaller and smaller sizes, traditional silicon chips are not likely to prove useful in solving humanity's greatest challenges, from climate change, to global starvation, to incurable diseases. But the quantum computer, which harnesses the power and complexity of the atomic realm, already promises to be every bit as revolutionary as the transistor and microchip once were. Its unprecedented gains in computing power herald advancements that could change every aspect of our daily lives. Automotive companies, medical researchers, and consulting firms are betting on quantum computing, hoping to exploit its power to design more efficient vehicles, create life-saving new drugs, and streamline industries to revolutionize the economy. But this is only the beginning. Quantum computers could allow us to finally create nuclear fusion reactors that create clean, renewable energy without radioactive waste or threats of meltdown. They could help us crack the biological processes that generate natural, cheap fertilizer and enable us to feed the world's growing populations. And they could unravel the fiendishly difficult protein folding that lies at the heart of previously incurable diseases like Alzheimer's, ALS, and Parkinson's, helping us to live longer, healthier lives. There is not a single problem humanity faces that couldn't be addressed by quantum computing. Told with Kaku's signature clarity and enthusiasm, Quantum Supremacy is the story of this exciting frontier and the race to claim humanity's future"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285758
285757	1	One Nation Under Drones : | Legality, Morality, and Utility of Unmanned Combat Systems /	Jackson, John E.	"One Nation Under Drones is an interesting and informative review of how robotic and unmanned systems are impacting every aspect of American life, from how we fight our wars to how we play to how we grow our food. Edited by John Jackson, this highly readable book features chapters from a dozen experts, researchers, and operators of the sophisticated systems that have become ubiquitous across the nation and around the world. Press reports have focused primarily on unmanned aerial vehicles, officially designated as UAVs, but more often referred to as "drones."  This work takes you behind the scenes and describes how Predators, Reapers, Scan Eagles, and dozens of other pilotless aircraft have been used to fight the Global War on Terrorism. Although these systems seemed to emerge fully-developed into the skies above America's distant battlefields following the attacks of September 11, 2001, readers will discover that they actually trace their lineage to World War I, when the "automatic airplane/aerial torpedo," designed and built by the Sperry Gyroscope Company, made its first flight just over a century ago. Unmanned aircraft were used by various combatants in World War II and took many forms: from converted manned bombers to intercontinental attacks on the American homeland by rice-paper balloons. Technology developed in the latter decades of the 20th century enabled crews stationed thousands of miles away to attack targets on remote battlefields. Such long-range and remote-controlled weapons have been extensively used but are controversial from both legal and ethical standpoints. Chapters written by international law specialists and drone pilots with advanced education in ethics address these issues from both sides of the argument. The book also details how robotic systems are being used on land, in and below the seas, and in civilian applications such as driverless cars. Three dozen photographs display drones as small as an insect up to those as large as a 737 airliner. One Nation Under Drones covers such a wide array of topics that it will be of interest to everyone from the casual reader seeking to know more about these systems to national security professionals, both in and out of uniform, who will be making decisions about their procurement and use in decades to come.

285756	1	Think Tanks in Australia : | Policy Contributions and Influence /	Hagland, Trent.	This book provides the most comprehensive study of the Australian think-tank industry to date. Drawing on empirical evidence, it first assesses the structure of the industry, the methods think tanks use to persuade policymakers, and public perceptions of their effectiveness. The book then proceeds to examine three unique policy cases to analyse think tank influence on policymaking. It argues that whilst think tanks play important roles in Australia's policy process, their impacts vary depending on their approach and objectives. The book also demonstrates that policymakers with contrasting ideological orientations diverge in their assessments of the utility and influence of think tanks. It will appeal to students and scholars of public policy, and practitioners in public administration and governance.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285756
285755	1	Grand Delusion : | The Rise and Fall of American Ambition in the Middle East /	Simon, Steven.	"A longtime American foreign policy insider's biting and definitive reckoning with the high cost of this country's ambitious meddling in the Middle East-and its bitter end The culmination of almost 40 years of expertise and insider policy access, Grand Delusion is Steven Simon's tour de force, offering a comprehensive yet analytical tour of U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Simon begins with the Reagan administration, when the Middle East shifted from a group of faraway and frequently squabbling nations to an urgent opportunity for America to (in Reagan's words) "serve the cause of world peace and the future of mankind." Assuring citizens that "we owe it to ourselves and to our children" to be a force for peace in the region, Reagan fired the starting gun on decades of profound American involvement. As the U.S. economy became increasingly reliant on oil and as policy and diplomatic momentum gathered, the Middle East became more and more central to foreign policy, and more and more likely to be the subject of grand rhetoric, until the Obama administration ended an era by turning away from the region. Grand Delusion explores the motivations, approach, and legacy of each administration up to today, showing us a complex spiderweb of intertwined events-from Lebanese civil conflict to shifting Iranian domestic politics, to Saudi Arabia's quest for security-through the lens of a Washington policy process frequently ruled by cognitive bias, wishful thinking, and outright malfeasance. Simon's sharp sense of humor and incisive analytical powers bring a complex history to life. Despite an impressive DC resume-he rose to become the National Security Council senior director for Middle Eastern and North African affairs-Simon never fails to tell the truth as he sees it. He challenges the nature of American commitment to Israel; disputes the popular narrative of Desert Storm as a "good war"; and calls out the enormous consequences of our mistakes, particularly for victims of American military action. As Grand Delusion shows, this story is only occasionally impressive, and frequently disgraceful. But it's a story with deep and enduring resonance for the future of both the U.S. and the Middle East"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285755
285754	1	War, Peace and the Military : | Sociological Perspectives /	Kernic, Franz.	This book is a comprehensive analysis of the various social science approaches to explaining and interpreting war, peace and the military. Its central aim is to trace and reconstruct those basic assumptions constructed and 'thought processes' undertaken by modern social sciences in their research and conceptualization of military violence and the use of force. In addition to such reconstruction, the aim is also to enquire into the preconditions of such thought. This study therefore eschews the development of an explicit 'strategy' (in the sense of a research strategy), but instead is much more concerned with thinking about its subject matter by means of re-thinking and reflecting upon different theoretical approaches and problems. The investigation includes a critical reexamination of the tradition of military-sociological research from the beginning of modern sociology to late-twentieth century theoretical approaches regarding the security-focused and/or war-driven aspects of modern society.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285754

In Escalation Dynamics in Cyberspace, Erica D. Lonergan and Shawn W. Lonergan tackle this question head-on, presenting a comprehensive theory that explains the conditions under which cyber operations may lead to escalation. In doing so, they challenge long-held assumptions about strategic interactions in cyberspace, arguing that cyberspace is not as dangerous as the conventional wisdom might suggest. In some cases, cyber operations could even facilitate the de-escalation of international crises. Through extensive case studies that explore the role of cyber operations in routine competition, crises, and warfighting, Escalation Dynamics in Cyberspace presents nuanced insights about how cyberspace affects international politics.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285753

285751	1	The Metaverse : | and How It Will Revolutionize Everything /	Ball, Matthew.	"From the leading theorist of the Metaverse comes the definitive account of the next internet: what the Metaverse is, what it will take to build it, and what it means for all of us. The term "Metaverse" is suddenly everywhere, from the front pages of national newspapers and the latest fashion trends to the plans of the most powerful companies in history. It is already shaping the policy platforms of the US government, the European Union, and the Chinese Communist Party. But what, exactly, is the Metaverse? As pioneering theorist and venture capitalist Matthew Ball explains, it is a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences, and also underpin much of the physical world. For decades, these ideas have been limited to science fiction and video games, but they are now poised to revolutionize every industry and function, from finance and healthcare to education, consumer products, city planning, dating, and well beyond. Taking us on an expansive tour of the "next internet," Ball demonstrates that many proto-Metaverses are already here, such as Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox. Yet these offer only a glimpse of what is to come. Ball presents a comprehensive definition of the Metaverse before explaining the technologies that will power it-and the breakthroughs that will be necessary to fully realize it. He addresses the governance challenges the Metaverse entails; investigates the role of Web3, blockchains, and NFTs; and predicts Metaverse winners and losers. Most importantly, he examines many of the Metaverse's almost unlimited applications. The internet will no longer be at arm's length; instead, it will surround us, with much of our lives, labor, and leisure taking place inside the Metaverse. Bringing clarity and authority to a frequently misunderstood concept, Ball foresees trillions of dollars in new value-and the radical reshaping of society"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285751

285623	1	Armed groups : | the twenty-first-century threat /	Thompson, Peter G.,	Armed Groups is the most comprehensive text to provide a framework for categorizing the key actors that pose a threat to today's security arena--terrorists, mercenaries, insurgents, militias, and transnational criminal organizations--and analyzing their characteristics to provide a thorough overview. Drawing on case studies, histories, and a rich, yet underexplored theoretical literature, this study presents students with the tools to methodically examine these often overlooked, but key drivers of violence in the international system. Additionally, globalization, the privatization of force, and the return of great power competition have altered the security landscape and enhanced armed group threats. These forces have also led to an increasing overlap between conflict and crime, and a growth in the state use of armed group proxies. Coming to terms with armed groups--their objectives, strategies, internal composition, and the environment that fosters them--remains a critical task for practitioners, scholars, and policy makers alike in understanding the changing nature of war. This second edition, updated throughout, includes new material on the importance of private military companies, the shift to sub-Saharan Africa as an important center of conflict, the return of great power politics, the increased use of social media and advanced technology, and the increasingly criminalized nature of armed groups.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285623

285618	1	Macroeconomics and Financial Crises : | Bound Together by Information Dynmmics /	Gorton, Gary B.,	"After the Great Depression John Maynard Keynes led the way in building a new macroeconomic framework to deal with that unprecedented economic reality. Ten years after our own crisis, however, macroeconomics has not come to terms with how to grapple with the idea of financial crises in its models. In the stylized world of macroeconomic theory, crises are not an inherent or structural element. Gary Gorton and Guillermo Ordonez, who were prominent experts to first authoritatively respond to the financial crisis of 2008 have since been working to understand what needs to change in macroeconomic models to incorporate and address financial crises. In this book Gorton and Ordonez provide an authoritative first step on how to rebuild macroeconomics in a way that can take into account financial crises, and they make a strong case that we need to rethink things at a fundamental level. In the book they bring together ten years of work on what needs to happen. Their two key ideas of what has missing are information and credit. More specifically, how information and credit interact, for example, when investors learn that certain types of debt aren't safe investments and we see bank runs. Gorton and Ordonez provide a way to model this interaction and a roadmap of how to incorporate it into a macroeconomic equilibrium" ¦ "How financial crises are inherent features of macroeconomic dynamicsThere are no bigger disruptions in the functioning of economies than financial crises. Yet prior to the crash of 2007-2008, macroeconomics incorporated financial crises simply as bad shocks, like earthquakes, failing to consider them as an intrinsic phenomenon of the evolution of macroeconomic variables, such as credit, investment, and productivity. Macroeconomics and Financial Crises rethinks how technological change, credit booms, and endogenous information production combine to generate financial crises as inherent and recurrent reactions to macroeconomic dynamics.Gary Gorton and Guillermo Ordoñez identify short-term debt, collateral, and information as common elements that are present in all financial crises. Short-term debt is a critical element for storing value over short periods without fear of loss, but there needs to be collateral backing the debt. Critically, the collateral should be such that no agent wants to produce information about its quality. The debt backed by such collateral is information-insensitive. Gorton and Ordoñez argue that, during a credit boom, as more and more firms get loans, the economy reaches a tipping point where information production becomes too tempting, disrupting short-term debt and cutting most firms out of the credit market.Showing how a financial crisis is an information event triggered by the dynamics of macroeconomic variables, Macroeconomics and Financial Crises provides new perspectives on the intricate relations between macroeconomics and financial crises"							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285618

285616	1	New military strategies in the Gulf : | the mirage of autonomy in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar /	Samaan, Jean-Loup,	In the last decade, rulers in Gulf regimes have aspired to greater strategic autonomy and distance from the West. Coined the "Gulf moment" by local commentators, this regional trend reflects a redistribution of power in the Arab world. This is the first book to examine the military dimensions of these shifts. Gulf military strategy has prioritised the improvement of local armed forces and the diversification of defence partnerships towards countries such as Russia, Turkey or China. However, this book shows how this has led to the militarisation of Gulf societies, the further erosion of multilateral initiatives - including the Gulf Cooperation Council - and the Gulf's perilous involvement in the war in Yemen. The book also highlights enduring reliance on the West. Each chapter covers a key aspect of defence policy from governance of armed forces, military education and power projection capabilities to regional security cooperation and lessons from warfighting experiences. Close attention is paid to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, countries that have enjoyed prominent roles in the region's security affairs during the last ten years. The research is based on extensive fieldwork and interviews with major decision-makers, officials, and diplomatic and military representatives. It is also uses recently declassified official documents to gain rare insight into what Gulf countries intend for their defence policies.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285616

285610	1	How terrorists learn : | organizational learning and beyond /		"This volume helps us understand the transformations of terrorist organisations, and the conflicts they are involved in, by broadening the perspective on what is considered terrorist learning. Using a variety of methodological approaches and empirical data, the volume offers a look at the clandestine inner lives of groups from different continents and ideological backgrounds in order to explore from whom they learn and how, and what the outcomes are. Their internal and external interactions are examined within their socio-political contexts to illuminate how they adapt to challenges or fail to do so. Unpacking the question of 'how do terrorists learn' helps us to grasp not only changes of violent means of action but also of operational and strategic approaches and, ultimately, even transformations of the ends pursued. The chapters demonstrate that terrorist learning is not principally different from that of other human organisations. The contributors draw on conceptual frameworks of organizational learning, but also broaden the scope beyond the organizational framework to acknowledge the variety of forms of informal and decentralized learning characteristic of much contemporary terrorism. This book will be of much interest to students of terrorism studies, violent extremism, organisational studies and International Relations"							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285610

285608	1	Contextualizing sectarianism in the Middle East and South Asia : | identity, competition and conflict /		States across the Muslim world are faced with challenges associated with a perpetual cycle of conflict and violence organized along sectarian lines. To understand modern-day sectarianism, it is essential to move beyond explanations that focus predominantly on ancient Sunni-Shia animosities or a singular lens. It is important to engage in interdisciplinary and multidirectional examinations to better understand how sectarianism is strategically utilized by political entrepreneurs. Moreover, while religious identities and how individuals define themselves and their communities are important, it is also integral to analyze how identity has been utilized in historical and contemporary political contexts on state and non-state levels. This volume seeks to fill gaps in understanding the complexities associated with sectarianism through a transnational interdisciplinary analytical framework to enhance understanding of the socio-political, religio-political, cultural and security landscapes of the Middle East and South Asia. It also challenges narratives regarding sectarian divisions between Sunnis and Shias and deconstructs popular misconceptions about sectarianism, its spatial and temporal impact, as well as its influence on identities, conflict, and competition. The volume will be of interest to scholars and researchers of the Middle East and South Asia, and those interested in history, politics, international relations, international security, religion, and sociology.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285608

Based on an empirically grounded and theoretically informed retrospective on nearly thirty years of post-conflict democratic state-building efforts, it examines whether this practice has contributed to peace and finds that engaging post-rebel parties in electoral politics has proven to be a viable long-term strategy for bringing political stability, that disparate post-rebel parties from different political contexts invest heavily in electoral politics and that few post-rebel parties actively seek return to civil conflict as a solution after becoming a political party. This book will be of key interest to scholars, students and practitioners in democracy, governance, elections, political parties, post-conflict peacebuilding, and more broadly to international relations, comparative politics, and regional politics"							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285607

285597	1	Shaping National Security : | International Emergency Mechanisms and Disaster Risk Reduction /		"Shaping National Security: International Emergency Mechanisms and Disaster Risk Reduction presents international emergency mechanisms relative to disaster risk reduction (DRR). The goal is to share knowledge about existing frameworks, and utilize established DRR policies and programs, as another means to reinforce and strengthen national security in countries around the world. The book outlines, in detail, the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC), the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) DRR programs. While these entities' versions of DRR best practices are largely directed at decreasing the impact of disaster hazards, limiting relevant exposure, local vulnerabilities, increasing capacities to cope with disaster, the authors present these frameworks as potential tools, and effective means, to support national security efforts. This is especially important in disaster circumstances when local, and national emergency resources, may be insufficient to face hazards and multi-hazards, and result in cascading effects to occur as hazard events transpire. Chapters present various resources available to them, through these programs, to encourage authorities from every country to effectively apply the mechanisms-and emergency mechanisms specifically-to offer domestic solutions. Due to these programs proven track records in providing organisational standards, the use of such mechanisms can serve as both the basis to foster sound DRR practices and, by extension, can supplement resiliency, security, and continuity within countries. This concept is based on the premise that the UNDAC, INSARAG, NATO and ECPM emergency mechanisms have been developed to be implementable (directly or indirectly) in every country in the world when disasters occur. Shaping National Security takes a "big-picture," holistic view of DRR and national security to offer innovative ideas and solutions to professionals and officials working in disaster management, disaster risk reduction, emergency management, crisis management, civil protection, public security management, national security, criminal justice, international studies, and homeland security"							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285597

285594	1	Foreign aid : | policy and practice /	Pomerantz, Phyllis R.,	"Foreign Aid: Policy and Practice offers a complete overview of the basics of foreign aid. Who is it for? Who pays for it? Why does it exist? What is it spent on? How much is it? And most importantly, does it work? The aid debate has been flooded by academic studies and popular books which either challenge or champion the effectiveness of aid. Most presume that the reader already knows the basic facts and characteristics of the aid industry. This book provides readers with a comprehensive summary of the background, actors, core principles and policies, and intended (and unintended) outcomes of foreign aid, followed by a more informed and balanced treatment of the key controversies and trends in aid today. Drawing on the author's 25 years' experience in development practice and 15 years in teaching, the book reflects on recent efforts to accelerate aid's impact and concludes by taking a balanced look at the future of aid and the headwinds it will face in the first half of the 21st century. Perfect for university teaching at advanced undergraduate and graduate levels, this book will also encourage development practitioners, policy makers and members of the public to engage in more informed debates about aid and development finance"							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285594
285593	1	Public management reform in the Gulf Cooperation Council and beyond /	Biygautane, Mhamed,	"This book offers an understanding of the current state of public management in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, highlighting the region's institutional and human capital constraints. Drawing on case studies from GCC states and beyond, the text provides a policy-oriented analysis of these challenges and a set of recommendations on how to address them. Public Management Reform in the Gulf Cooperation Council and Beyond utilizes several theoretical frameworks to explore three themes: first, how the quality of government and efficiency of its bureaucratic machinery can offer a business-friendly environment for the private sector; second, how public-private partnerships can foster stronger collaboration and exchange of knowledge and expertise between the public and private sectors; and finally, how the existing human capital constraints may be addressed through the effective implementation of talent management, knowledge management, and training programs. A comparative approach is taken throughout the book, contrasting the performance of GCC states with other Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries in key governance, public sector performance, and business competitiveness indicators - to identify what the GCC states need to do to enhance the quality of government and the capacity to deliver services more efficiently. This book will appeal to academics, practitioners, policymakers and private sector consultants, as well as those interested more broadly in the Middle East and Gulf region"							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285593

Covering the greater Middle East-including the Arab States, Israel, Turkey, and Iran-the book establishes how militaries in many Middle Eastern countries influence the national political and economic systems and how, in turn, politics influences the national militaries"-- Provided by publisher							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285590

285132	2	من تاريخ الحركات الدينية في الإسلام /	شراينر، مارتين،	حسب أبحاث ألفرد فون كريمر وغولدتسيهر أصبح حقيقة معترفا بها أن غالبية الحركات الدينية في الإسلام تعود إلى مركب من الأفكار الدينية ذات منشأ مختلف. ولا يمكن تفسير تشكلات الفرق الدينية، وتقديس الأولياء، وكثير من الظواهر الأخرى، إلا كنواتج لإدراك الشعوب الإسلامية لتعاليم النبي محمد. إذ إن عناصر الوعي الشعبي الوثني القديم بقيت مستمرة تحت غلاف إسلامي، كما أن الإسلام حاول التكيف مع هذه العناصر المناقضة له في الأصل. وكرد على مثل هذه الظواهر، وكعلامة على إحياء الإسلام الأول، تعد بحق دعوة محمد عبد الوهاب \"الوهابية\" التي تجد لها سوابق في التاريخ الإسلامي القديم وكان رد الفعل التوحيدي قبل الوهابي يعترض على بعض تجاوزات الصوفية وتقديس الأولياء وعلي العادات الغريبة أو الخرافية، وعلي بعض العلوم التنبوئية كعلم التنجيم، على سبيل المثال. أما ممثلوها فهم بمعظمهم مسلمون أصوليون لا يقبلون أي مصدر للمعرفة الدينية سوى القرآن والسنة. ولذلك فإن محاربتهم لا تقتصر، أحيانا، على الظواهر التي يجدون فيها تناقضا للأفكار التوحيدية، وإنما تشمل أيضا العقلانية والتصوف. فبالنسبة إلى هذه الأصولية لا يقتصر الرفض على العقلانية المتطرفة للمسلمين الأرسططاليين، بل يشمل أيضا أنصار علم الكلام الأشعري. من أجل معرفة ردود فعل الحركات قبل \"دعوة عبد الوهاب\" الوهابية سأقدم فيما يلي بعض المقالات التي يتبين منها أن الإسلام كما كان يفهم في الزمن الأقدم كان له أيضا، قبل ظهور الدعوة الوهابية، مؤيدون متشددون. ولكن سيتبين أيضا أن الإسلام لم يخل أيضا بعد الأشعري من الحركات الدينية الكبيرة التي كانت أتباعها يكافحون من أجل المسائل الأهم للمعرفة الدينية وهي أن العقلانية والصوفية قد أديا إلى نتائج مشابهة، كما في اليهودية والمسيحية، وهي أنهما تعودان، جزئيا، إلى المؤثرات الأدبية نفسها.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285132
285031	3	دور الدولة في تنظيم الذكاء الاصطناعي : | تطويراً و رقابةً و تشجيعاً عن طريق الاستراتيجيات الوطنية /	بابيشيف، جليب،	أطلقت حكوماتٌ كثيرةٌ في أنحاء العالم، في السنوات الخمس الماضية، استراتيجيات وطنية للذكاء الاصطناعي؛ بهدف اغتنام الفرص التي تُوجِدها هذه التكنولوجيا، ومعالجة التحديات التي تكتنفها. وتستخدِم هذه الدراسة أسلوب "تحليل المحتوى النوعي"، ومنهجية نمذجة الموضوعات المعروفة باسم "خوارزمية ديريتشليت للتوزيع الكامن"، أداتين لتحليل مضمون 31 استراتيجية وطنية أطلقتها بلدان مختلفة بالعالم، ونُشِرَت في المدة من عام 2017 إلى 2021، وتكشف الدراسة عن 13 دورًا للدولة، تتعلق بتنظيم الذكاء الاصطناعي؛ وذلك وفقًا لثلاثة محاور عامة هي: التطوير، والرقابة، والتشجيع.  وتُبيِّن الدراسة أن البلدان الأوروبية في كتلة الاتحاد السوفييتي السابق، والصين، ودول شرق آسيا، تضع موضوع "التطوير" في مقدمة أولوياتها، وتضطلع الدولة بدورٍ تنسيقيٍّ في حوكمة النظام الاجتماعي التقني للذكاء الاصطناعي في هذه المجموعة، في الوقت الذي تتعاون فيه مع مختلف أصحاب المصلحة الرئيسيين، وتسهم على نحوٍ مباشر وغير مباشر في تطوير الذكاء الاصطناعي، في حين تميل بلدان الاتحاد الأوروبي إلى إعطاء الأولوية لموضوع "الرقابة"، التي يمكن تحديدها عن طريق القيام، على مستوى الاتحاد، بمحاولةٍ لتنظيم هذه التكنولوجيا، وحماية الحقوق الأساسية للمواطنين من مخاطر الذكاء الاصطناعي. وفي المقابل اختارت دول في مجموعة "التشجيع"، مثل المملكة المتحدة، والولايات المتحدة الأمريكية، وإيرلندا، نهجًا غير مباشر من أجل تنظيم الذكاء الاصطناعي.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=285031

284240	6	זאיד: מִן מאתגר אל האיחוד /	Maitra, Jayanti	This book is a chronicle of the life and achievements of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan during the quarter century from 1946 to 1971 which witnessed his rise to power and fame from a tribal leader in the interior to the President of a modern nation-state. Based on exhaustively researched British archival records, the study presents an interesting and insightful analysis of the different stages of Sheikh Zayed’s political career set against several landmark events in the contemporary annals of the Emirates. During his twenty-year tenure as the Ruler’s Representative in Al Ain oasis, Zayed emerged as a great leader in the making. After becoming the Ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966, he succeeded in transforming the medieval Emirate into a modern metropolis by virtue of his supreme qualities of head and heart. As the pre-eminent figure in Gulf politics and the precursor of political unification in the region, Sheikh Zayed took the lead in establishing the Federation of the U.A.E. on 2nd December 1971 and became its first President. This marked the crowning archievement of his career and a defining moment in the history of the seven Emirates. A leader-statesman of legendary repute in the Arab World, and one of the greatest political figures of our times, Sheikh Zayed’s phenomenal contributions earned for him a memorable place in history.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=284240

284234	1	Gulf security: | identifying and confronting the challenges /		This book brings together the papers presented at ‘Gulf Security: Identifying and Confronting the Challenges,’ a symposium held at the Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research (ECSSR) on February 24, 2020. Highlighting the various challenges faced by GCC countries, amid the region’s strategic and geopolitical significance, the book examines the Gulf’s influence over global trade routes and its role in maintaining international energy security. The book underscores the vital importance of international cooperation and sound Arab leadership in the face of a growing number of challenges and threats, particularly against the backdrop of external interference in regional issues.    Several regional issues of global significance are explored, including the Iranian crisis and the resultant risks to maritime security amid repeated threats to close the Strait of Hurmuz. In responding to these issues, the book emphasizes the importance of pursuing political action to avoid military conflict in the region, which would result in catastrophic damage to the regional and wider global economy and global security. The book also addresses the transition from oil and gas to renewable energy, focusing on the implications for the GCC. Finally, the balance of international and intra-regional alliances in the Middle East is covered, examining the role of Russia, the US and China in response to the challenges that undermine the security and stability of the Arabian Gulf region.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=284234
284226	3	الذكاء الاصطناعي و البلوك تشين : | كيف ينبغي تنظيم التقنيات الناشئة ؟ /	كالينزي، كورنيليوس،	يعد تنظيم التقنيات الناشئة من أهم القضايا المطروحة في القرن الحادي والعشرين، ويتعلق أساساً بالمبادرات العامة والخاصة والاجتماعية، التي تحدد كيفية استخدام التقنيات الرقمية، وتطويرها بمسؤولية. وتتناول هذه الدراسة الإطار الجديد لتنظيم تقنيتي البلوك تشين والذكاء الاصطناعي، وترصد منظومة التقنيات الناشئة في القطاعين الصناعي والعام، وفي المجتمع المدني، وتحدد أبرز الجهات الفاعلة في القطاعين العام والخاص، وفي منظمات المجتمع المدني ودوافعها الرئيسية، وتحلل أوجه التشابه والاختلاف بين تلك الدوافع، وتأثيرها المحتمل في تنظيم التقنيات الناشئة مستقبلاً.   ولا خلاف في أن هذه التقنيات تمثل حاضر النمو الاقتصادي ومستقبله، غير أنها تمثل في الوقت نفسه مخاطرة كبيرة على المجتمع، ونجد كذلك ارتباكاً واختلافاً كبيرين بين الجهات الفاعلة بشأن التوازن الدقيق بين ترويج هذه االبتكارات وتعزيزها، وتقليص المخاطر الناجمة عنها. وفي حين تدعو بعض الأصوات داخل قطاع الصناعة إلى اعتماد التنظيم الذاتي، تطالب أصوات أخرى بسن قوانين صامة، و وضع تشريعات حكومية؛ لمراقبة هذه التقنيات، ويرجح أن تظل هذه الاختلافات قائمة في المستقبل المنظور، وقد تعوق وضع الأطر التنظيمية في مختلف السلطان القضائية.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=284226

284224	3	تمكين المرأة الخليجية : | جدل الداخل والخارج /	حافظ، فاطمة	شهدت منطقة الخليج العربي تطورات حثيثة يمكن وصفها بأنها الأبرز على صعيد تمكين النساء في العالم العربي بأسره؛ ففي بضع سنين فاق حجم المتغيرات وما خلفته من تأثيرات جملة ما تحقق في أوضاع النساء طيلة عقود، وتحديداً منذ انتهاج دول هذه المنطقة سياسة تعليم الفتيات.    ولعل الملمح البارز على هذا الصعيد هو التقاء جهات عديدة داخلية وخارجية وتبنيها سياسة تمكين المرأة في الخليج. ويحمل ذلك دلالتين: الأولى، أن اعتناق مؤسسة الدولة لسياسة التمكين كشف أن هناك تغيراً بنيوياً طرأ على رؤيتها المتعلقة بأدوار النساء ووظائفهن بوصفهن شركاء في المواطنة، وعليهن الإسهام في إنتاج مفردات الحياة السياسية والاقتصادية والثقافية. والثانية، ترتبط بذلك الدعم والتأييد الجارف الذي باتت تلقاه سياسة تمكين المرأة من قبل جهات ومؤسسات أجنبية.    تسعى هذه الدراسة، انطلاقاً من ذلك، إلى تناول أدوار الفاعلين الأساسيين واستراتيجياتهم بالرصد والتحليل، وذلك على مستويين: داخلي حيث تلعب مؤسسة الدولة دور الفاعل الأساسي في بعض البلدان، والفاعل الأوحد في بلدان أخرى. ومستوى خارجي، ممثل في دور الأمم المتحدة، وبعض الدول الغربية، ومنظمات المجتمع المدني العالمي الحقوقية.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=284224

284221	3	أزمة دارفور : | نظرة في الجذور والحلول الممكنة /	الأفندي، عبد الوهاب أحمد،	تسعى الدراسة للإجابة عن السؤال المهم : كيف يمكن أن يتحقق السلام في دارفور؟ ولكن للإجابة عن هذا السؤال لابد من إمعان النظر بعمق في الأسباب التي أدت إلى تفجر الصراع وأسهمت وتسهم في تغذيته. وهذا هو تحديدا ما تطمح هذه الدراسة إلى تقديمه عبر تتبع جذور الأزمة البعيدة، وأسبابها القريبة المباشرة ؛ للإجابة عن الأسئلة المطروحة عربيا وعالميا حول طبيعة الأزمة وأبعادها والأطراف المسؤولة عنها، ودور العوامل الداخلية والخارجية، إضافة إلى ملامح الحلول المتاحة لها. وبعد أن يناقش المؤلف خلفيات الأزمة وأسبابها وتفاعلاتها المحلية والإقليمية والدولية، فإنه يرى أن الحل الشامل للأزمة لابد أن يكون ذا شقين : الأول يتطلب إقامة سلطة مركزية ذات طابع ديمقراطي مفتوح، والثاني يرسي أسس المشاركة في هذه السلطة بحسب معادلة تجعل الكفاءة والتمثيل الحقيقي لطوائف الشعب المختلفة هي الأسس التي يتم على أساسها الاختيار. من الناحية النظرية حددت كل من اتفاقية السلام الشامل (التي أنهت الحرب في الجنوب) واتفاقية سلام دارفور مبادئ عريضة تصلح-إذا تم احترامها-لإرساء أسس توافق سوداني. وليست القضايا الخلافية المتبقية في شأن دارفور بمستعصية على الحل إذا وجدت الإرادة السياسية.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=284221

The formation of the United Arab Emirates on December 2, 1971 under the inspiring leadership of its founding father, H.H. Shaikh Zayid Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, is a unique example of the building of a prosperous nation that has earned its founder his rightful place among the outstanding statesmen of all time.

279774	3	جماعة الإخوان المسلمين في دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة : | الحسابات الخاطئة /	السويدي، جمال سند،	عبر التاريخ شهدت العديد من الحركات الدينية وعلى رأسها جماعة الإخوان المسلمين، مثلها مثل الأحزاب السياسية المحافظة، تصاعداً وازدهاراً خلال فترات الأزمات التي تمر بها الدول والمناطق الجغرافية من حين إلى آخر.  ويجب أن نفرق بين الدين الإسلامي الحنيف الذي يقوم على العبادات والمعاملات وأصول الدين وعدم الشرك؛ ودين الجماعات الدينية وعلى رأسها جماعة الإخوان المسلمين التي تحاول أن تسخر الدين لخدمة أهدافها ومصالحها والوصول إلى سدة الحكم والسلطة، فالأول ثابت لا يتغير، والثاني عرضة للتغيير.  مشكلة الجماعات الدينية وعلى رأسها جماعة الإخوان المسلمين أنها تعتقد أن نقدها هو نقد للدين، مع أن فكرها عبارة عن اجتهادات بشرية قابلة للصواب والخطأ، لذا أصبحت “تجارة الدين” من أبرز السمات الواضحة للمرحلة التاريخية الراهنة.  تعددت الحكايات والقصص والروايات حول نشأة جماعة الإخوان المسلمين في دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة، ولكن النشأة أو القصة بدأت عام 1962م، عندما جاء إليها القطري من أصول مصـرية السيد عبدالبديع صقر، وكان لحضور مجموعة من الإخوان المسلمين عام 1961م من قطر إلى دبي في دولة الإمارات دور رئيسـي في تأسيس جماعة الإخوان المسلمين في دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة، وحضـر مع عبدالبديع صقر، يوسف القرضاوي، وعبدالمنعم الستار، وأحمد العسال، وكمال ناجي.  جماعة الإخوان المسلمين في دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة اتبعت نموذج العمل لجماعة الإخوان المسلمين في جمهورية مصـر العربية ودولة الكويت، حيث تستخدم النموذج الكويتي في منطقة الخليج العربي والنموذج المصـري كنموذج أعلى ومثال للعمل السياسـي والدعوي.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=279774
279772	3	بقوة الاتحاد : | صاحب السمو الشيخ زايد بن سلطان آل نهيان : ¦ القائد و الدولة /		عبر التاريخ الطويل لم ينجح سوى قليل من القادة أصحاب الفكر والرؤية والعزيمة في بناء صرح دول راسخة بالإقناع والاتفاق. لقد كان إنشـاء دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة في 2 كانون الأول/ديسمبر 1971 تحت القيادة الملهمة للمغفور له بإذن الله تعالى سمو الشيخ زايد بن سلطان آل نهيان، مثالاً حياً لبناء هذه النوعية من الدول؛ مما جعل مؤسس الدولة يستحق عن جدارة مكان الصدارة بين أعظم رجال الدولة على مر العصور.    وفي الوقت الذي بدأت فيه بريطانيا بالانسحاب من منطقة الخليج العربي بادر الشيخ زايد إلى تحقيق المهمة الصعبة المتمثلة في توحيد الإمارات المتصالحة بعد أن كانت متفرقة، ليقيم دولة اتحادية هي الوحيدة في منطقة الشرق الأوسط. ثم عمد الشيخ زايد، الذي شاء قدره أن يكون زعيماً أجمع عليه أبناء شعبه، إلى ترسيخ دعائم الدولة من خلال توحيد القبائل، ثم بقوة الاتحاد عزَّز صرح الدولة في وجه التحديات الهائلة، آخذاً على عاتقه مبادرة التحديث والتطوير ليحقق في نهاية المطاف حلمه في بناء إطار فعال للتعاون مع الدول الخليجية المجاورة. وأضحت دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة منذ ذلك الحين قوة بنّاءة داخل المنطقة وخارجها، تجسد مبادئ الوحدة الوطنية والتسامح الديني، والتضامن الإقليمي، والتعاون الدولي.    هذا الكتاب يقدم دراسة معمقة لمولد دولة الاتحاد، وللدور المحوري لقائدها، وهو يتبنَّى منهجاً علمياً في تحليله التجربة الاتحادية الفريدة لدولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة، وإنجازاتها الضخمة، وفي تقصِّي بُعد نظر سمو الشيخ زايد في السياسات التي تبنَّاها. ويعتمد الكتاب -إلى حد بعيد- على الوقائع التي تم توثيقها توثيقاً دقيقاً؛ مما يجعله سجلاً بالغ الأهمية يرصد مرحلة مهمة في التاريخ المعاصر لمنطقة الخليج العربي. كما يقدم الكتاب سيرة موثقة ومحققة للمغفور له بإذن الله تعالى سمو الشيخ زايد بن سلطان آل نهيان، الرجل بنى أمة وأسس دولة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=279772
279771	3	الاتجاهات الجديدة في الدراسات الأمنية : | دراسة في تطور مفهوم الأمن في العلاقات الدولية /	قسوم، سليم ،	يبحث هذا الكتاب في تأثير التحول المعرفي الذي شهدته النظرية الاجتماعية بشكل عام، ونظرية العلاقات الدولية بشكل خاص، في عملية تنقيح مفهوم الأمن، وفي التحول المفاهيمي والنظري في الدراسات الأمنية، فهو يحاول دراسة التطور الذي شهده التفكير الأمني في مرحلة ما بعد الحرب الباردة عبر التركيز على الأطر والبنى المعرفية للاتجاهات النظرية الكبرى في العلاقات الدولية، من خلال الإجابة عن سؤال أساسي مفاده: إلى أي مدى أسهمت نظريات العلاقات الدولية في التطور الفكري الذي شهده مفهوم الأمن في فترة ما بعد الحرب الباردة؟    ويحلل الكتاب طبيعة حقل الدراسات الأمنية بالرجوع إلى أصوله المعرفية والمفهومية، عبر البحث في الأصول الاشتقاقية للأمن، وكذلك في السياقات التاريخية والنظرية لتطور الحقل، مع إبراز أهم القضايا والمسائل المشكّلة لبرنامج بحثه الخاص.    كما يدرس الكتاب أهم المفاهيم الأمنية التي انطوى عليها كل من النموذجين الواقعي والليبرالي كمفاهيم الأمن الوطني، والأمن الموسَّع، ونظرية السلام الديمقراطي، ودور المؤسسات الدولية في تعزيز الأمن، مع إبراز أهم المحاولات الساعية إلى تنقيح مفهوم الأمن وإعادة صياغته ضمن التيار العقلاني لفترة ما بعد الحرب الباردة.    ويخلص الكتاب إلى تأكيد النزعة المتمركزة على الذات في حقل الدراسات الأمنية، وعلى حقيقة أن مفهوم الأمن ليس مسألة منعزلة وقضية أكاديمية بحتة تخضع للتحولات الإبستيمولوجية، ولكنها مسألة سياسية أيضاً، إذ إنها مرتبطة بالخطاب السياسي المعاصر للدولة، وبالسيادة، وبالجماعة وبالهوية.    وعليه، فإن توسيع أو إعادة صياغة مفهوم الأمن ليس عملاً معرفياً بريئاً، ولكنه يتبدى أكثر بوصفه خطوة سياسية لتحقيق أهداف ومصالح معينة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=279771
279768	3	التخطيط الاستراتيجي في الصين و مستقبل الصراع الاقتصادي العالمي /	شعير، صلاح،	تُعزى النهضة الصينية إلى نجاح استراتيجيات تحديث الصناعة؛ وقد انعكس ذلك بالإيجاب على خفض تكاليف الإنتاج بنحو 30% عن تكاليف إنتاج السلع المثيلة في الدول المتقدمة؛ إضافة إلى النجاح في علاج المشكلات البيئة، والقضاء على التصحُّر، ومشكلات تآكل التربة، وتلوث الأنهار والبحار، وإعادة المراعي والغابات الطبيعية إلى سابق عهدها. وللحد من انبعاث غاز ثاني أكسيد الكربون يتم تحويل الكربون المنبعث من بعض المصانع إلى أسمدة كبريتية، وتمت مواجهة تلوث الهواء بزراعة نحو 20.54 مليون هكتار بالغابات الاصطناعية، توازي ثلث مساحة الغابات التي زُرِعت في العالم، وبالتالي اقترن علاج مشكلات البيئة بتوفير الغذاء، وانتهاء عصر المجاعات.    وتسعى الصين إلى تنشيط الاستثمار في مجال الطاقة المتجددة؛ لعلاج مشكلة الندرة في الطاقة، كما عملت على توظيف السياسة المالية والنقدية لخدمة الاستثمار، وأسفرت عملية الخصخصة عن زيادة الإنتاج، ونمو حركة التجارة الدولية. وإذا كانت الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية تحتل المركز الأول في العالم؛ طبقاً لتقويم الناتج المحلي بالأسعار الجارية للدولار، تليها الصين؛ فإن الصين حالياً تحتل المركز الأول في الناتج المحلي طبقاً لنظرية تعادل القوى الشرائية. وقد أسفر التفوق المستمر للصين عن إزاحة الولايات المتحدة من الأسواق الدولية؛ ما أشعل حدة المنافسة؛ ولذا لجأت الصين إلى فكرة بناء تكتل البريكس؛ لتكوين حائط صد يدعمها في هذا الصراع.    ويخلص هذا الكتاب إلى نتيجة جديدة مفادها أن التخطيط الاستراتيجي سوف يضع الاقتصاد الصيني في صدارة العالم في الفترة ما بين عامي 2029 و2033؛ وذلك بشرطين هما بقاء الأوضاع على ما هي عليه في عام 2017، وعجز الولايات المتحدة عن تصحيح أوضاعها الاقتصادية. وهذا التفوق المحتمل للصين ينذر بنشوب حروب تجارية طاحنة بين الصين والولايات المتحدة، بدأت بوادرها تلوح في الأفق. كما أثبت هذا الكتاب أن اشتعال الحرب التجارية سوف يضرب الاقتصاد العالمي في مقتل، وقد يؤدي إلى تراجع الناتج المحلي بنسبة 50%، وأن المستوى العام للأسعار من الممكن أن يتضاعف 7.14 مرة على الأقل كل عام، وأن البطالة في العالم لن تقل عن 188 مليون عاطل سنوياً قابلة للزيادة حسب مدة المواجهة.    وأخيراً يحذّر الكتاب من خطر تحول الصراع الاقتصادي إلى مواجهات عسكرية بالوكالة، أو مباشرة، أو عبر استخدام أسلحة الدمار الشامل.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=279768

279764	3	زايد المؤسس /		إن أهم ما يميز هذا الكتاب ثلاثة أمور: الأمر الأول هو أنه يجمع بين المنهج العلمـي القائم على التوثيق الدقيق للحوادث والمعلومات، والأسلوب البسـيط البعيد عن التعقيد، الذي يعرض المعلومات بشكل مباشـر سهل الفهم والاستيعاب؛ وهذا يجعلـه َّ موجًهـا إلى القراء من كل الأعمار والمستويات العلمية، وليس ً مقصورا على المتخصصـين فقط. الأمـر الثاني هو أنه كتاب شامل; بمعنى أنه لا يتناول ً جانبا ً واحد، أو عددا من الجوانب المتعلقـة بسـيرة الشـيخ زايد، رحمه االله، كما يحدث في الكثير من الكتب، وإنما يقدم صورة متكاملـة بأسلوب مختصـر ومبسط؛ ومن َّ ثم, فإن قـراءة هـذا الكتـاب تـوفر معرفـة غزيـرة حـول الشـيخ زايد، سواء للدارسـين، أو البـاحثين، أو الإعلاميـين، أو حتـى للقـراء العـاديين، فضلا عن المهتمين بتاريخ دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة وقائدها المؤسس. الأمر الثالث هو أن هذا الكتاب يعطي الأهمية الكبرى للجانب المعلوماتي القائم عـلى التوثيـق الـدقيق، من دون الاستغراق ً كثيرا في الجوانب التحليلية، وهو ما يتسق مع الهدف منه; وهو تقـديم معلومات شاملة َّ ومبسطة في الوقت نفسه، حول الشــيخ زايـد طيـب االله ثـراه إلى كـل المهتمين بالتعرف إلى هذا القائد التاريخي العظيم : السـيرة والمسـيرة.    وفي ضوء ما سبق يتكون هذا الكتاب من ثمانية فصول، يأتي الفصل الأول منها تحت عنوان: النشأة والبدايات، ويتناول الروافد المختلفة التي شكلت شخصـية الشـيخ زايـد، رحمه االله، وفكره، من حيث التعليم والتربية والسمات الشخصـية والبيئـة التـي نشـأ فيهـا وهواياته، وغيرها من الأمور التي وقفت وراء ظهور هـذه الشخصــية التاريخيـة الرائـدة والاستثنائية في التاريخ الإماراتي والخليجي والعربي والعالمي. ويجيء الفصل الثـاني تحـت عنوان: حكم العين، حيث يتناول الفترة التي حكم فيها الشـيخ زايد, طيب االله ثراه, مدينة العين خلال الفترة من عام 1946 إلى عام 1966 ,والإنجازات الكبيرة التـي حققهـا هنـاك على المستويات المختلفة، وكيف تعامل مع التحديات الكبـيرة التـي واجهتـه، فضـلا عـن عبقرية القيادة لديه، وقوة إرادته، ومنهجه في التوفيق بين القبائل، وفكره الوحدوي الـذي عن نفسه خلال هذه المرحلة في الكثير من المظاهر, أهمها ما قام بـه مـن دور َّعبر إيجـابي في إطار مجلس الإمارات المتصالحة منذ إنشائه في عام 1952 .وحول مرحلة حكم أبوظبي من عام 1966 إلى عام 1971 يجيء الفصل الثالث، الذي يتناول الـدور الكبـير الـذي قـام بـه الشـيخ زايد رحمه االله في بناء إمارة أبوظبي، وتحديثها على المستويات المختلفـة، وخاصـة الاقتصادية والمؤسسـية، وكيف كانت هذه المرحلة بمنزلة تمهيد لتحويل حلم الوحدة لدى الشـيخ زايد إلى واقع في عام 1971 .ويتعرض الفصل الرابع بالتفصيل لدور الشـيخ زايد، رحمه االله, في بناء دولة الاتحاد، متناولا الكثير من القضايا مثل: فلسفة الوحدة لدى الشـيخ  زايد, طيب االله ثراه، وكيـف أنهـا كانـت تمثـل في رؤيتـه وفكره أساسـا للمنَعـة والتقـدم والاستقرار، والخطوات العملية التي اتخذها الشـيخ زايد على طريق تحقيق الوحدة منذ أن كان حاكما للعين، ثم حاكما لأبوظبي، والطريق الطويل والصعب الذي سـار فيـه في هـذا الخصوص، وهذا ًفضلا عن نهج الشـيخ زايـد في تحقيـق الوحـدة والمحافظـة عليهـا.    وفي الفصل الخامس من الكتاب, الذي يتحدث عن زايد وبناء الدولـة, يـتم التعـرض للدور الكبير الذي قام به الشـيخ زايد رحمه االله في بناء دولة الاتحاد عـلى المسـتويين الدسـتوري والمؤسسـي, ووضع تنمية الإنسان في قمة الأولويات، وتعزيـز نهـج الشـورى وســياسة الباب المفتوح، وبناء نموذج تنموي قائم على التوازن والشمول والاستدامة، وبناء قـوات مسلحة عصـرية، وتأسـيس نظام إداري متطور، إضافة إلى بناء نموذج تنموي يقـوم عـلى المواءمة بين الأصالة والمعاصـرة. ويهتم الفصل السادس بالجانب الإنساني في حياة الشـيخ زايد, حيث يتناول الكثير من القضايا مثل: روافد نهج الشـيخ زايـد في العمـل الإنسـاني، ورؤية الشـيخ زايد لكيفية التعامل مـع الثـروة، ومفهـوم وأسـس الشــيخ زايـد للعمـل الإنساني، وإنجازات الشـيخ زايد رحمه االله، في مجال العمل الإنساني، والتقـدير الإقليمـي والدولي للشـيخ زايد لدوره المتميز في العمل الإنساني والتنموي. أما الفصل السابع، فإنـه يركز على السـياسة الخارجية في فكر الشـيخ زايد, طيب االله ثراه, مـن خـلال الكثـير مـن الجوانب، لعل أهمها: أهداف السـياسة الخارجية لدى الشــيخ زايـد, رحمـه االله, ومبـادئ السـياسة الخارجية في فكره، ودوره في تعزيز العمل الخليجـي المشـترك، والعمـل العـربي المشترك، إضافة إلى دعم القضـية الفلسطينية، ورؤيته للعلاقات الدولية في حفـظ السـلام العالمي. وفي كل ما سبق؛ فإن الدعوة إلى السـلام، وحـل الخلافـات بـين الـدول بـالطرق السلمية، والـدعوة إلى التعـاون والتعاضـد الإنسـاني، كانـتً أهـدافاً رئيســية للســياسة الخارجية في فكر المغفور له, بإذن االله تعالى, الشـيخ زايد. ًوأخيراً يأتي الفصل الثامن تحـت عنوان "قالوا عن زايد"؛ ليرصد أهم الشـهادات التـي قالهـا القـادة والمسـؤولون العـرب والأجانب عن الشـيخ زايد, رحمه االله, ودوره المتميـز عـبر التـاريخ، فضـلاً عـن الجـوائز ومظاهر التكريم التي حظي بها من مؤسسات مختلفـة عالميـة وإقليميـة؛ بسـبب إسـهاماته الكبرى في خدمة الإنسانية والتنمية والسلام عبر العالم.  وعلى الرغم من أن كتاب “زايد المؤسس" يتبنَّى رؤية شاملة في تناول سـيرة الشــيخ زايد, طيب االله ثراه, ويحرص على التعرض للجوانـب المتعلقـة بهـذه الســيرة كافـة؛ فـإن حياته, رحمه االله, تظل دائماً مادة ثرية للبحث والتنقيب أمام الباحثين عبر التاريخ، كـما أنهـا من العمق والغزارة بحيث لا يمكن لكتاب، مهما كانت شموليته، الإحاطـة الكاملـة بهـا، ومن ثم يظل الكتاب الذي بين أيدينا محاولة بحثية في سـيرة قائد إماراتي عظيم، تحتـاج إلى المزيد من الجهد والتطوير في المستقبل؛ حتى يمكـن إيفـاء كـل جوانـب القيـادة العبقريـة للشـيخ زايد, رحمه االله, حقها.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=279764
279762	3	التطور الثقافي : | تغير دوافع الشعوب و إعادة تشكيل العالم /	إنجلهارت، رونالد إف،	يعرض كتاب “التطور الثقافي: تغير دوافع الشعوب وإعادة تشكيل العالم” للفكرة القائلة إن قيم الناس وسلوكهم تتشكل بدرجة الأمان التي يكون عليها وجودهم. ففي معظم فترات التاريخ كان بقاء الناس محفوفاً بالمخاطر؛ وهو ما حدا بهم إلى التضامن فيما بينهم، ورفض الآخر، والإذعان لقادتهم الأقوياء. ففي حالات الندرة الشديدة والشُّح تصبح كراهية الآخر واقعاً ملموساً. فلو كانت هناك مساحة من الأرض تستوعب قبيلة واحدة، وحاولت قبيلة أخرى الاستيلاء عليها، لأصبح البقاء مسألة خيار بين “نحن” و”هُم”. وعلى العكس من ذلك تشجع المستويات العليا من الأمان الوجودي الانفتاح على التغير والتنوع والأفكار الجديدة. وبعد الحرب العالمية الثانية شهد العالم درجة غير مسبوقة من الأمان والازدهار أدت إلى تغيرات ثقافية، وظهور الحركات المناصرة للبيئة، وانتشار الديمقراطية. لكن في العقود الأخيرة تراجع الأمان الوظيفي، وزادت درجة عدم المساواة؛ ما أدى إلى رد فعل استبدادي. وثمة دليل مستمَد من أكثر من مئة دولة يبرهن على أن دوافع الشعوب وسلوكها انعكاس للمدى الذي يرون فيه أن بقاءهم شيء بديهي، وأن التحديث يغيّر الناس على نحو يمكن التنبؤ به. ويفسر الكتاب -من خلال نظرية التحديث القائمة على الاختبار التجريبي- ظهور أحزاب البيئة والحركات الداعية إلى المساواة بين الجنسين وزواج المثليين، وكذلك الظروف التي جاءت بدونالد ترامب رئيساً للولايات المتحدة الأمريكية، وخروج بريطانيا من الاتحاد الأوروبي، ونشأة الجبهة الوطنية في فرنسا.    إن بعض الأكاديميين الذين أدلوا برأيهم في الكتاب رأوا فيه واحداً من أهم كتب العلوم الاجتماعية التي صدرت في العقود الأخيرة (ريتشارد جونثر من جامعة أوهايو)، وبعضهم قالوا عنه إنه كتاب مؤثر (روبرت بوتنام من جامعة هارفارد)، وبعضهم رشحوه للقارئ المهتم بفهم قوى التغير الثقافي (ميشيل جلفاند من جامعة مريلاند).							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=279762

267691	2	الوجيز في النظم السياسية و القانون الدستوري /	العضايلة، أمين سلامة.	يعد مصطلح الدولة حديث الظهور نسبياً، فبعد انتهاء الصراع بين الكنسية والإمبراطور في أوروبا، وتحرر السلطة الزمنية من سلطان البابا، أخذ الملوك يستعيدون نفوذهم ويركزون السلطة في أيديهم، وظهرت في القرن السادس عشر فكرة الدولة القومية المستقلة المحددة الإقليم والتي يرتبط سكانها فيما بينهم برابطة الوحدة والهدف المشترك، وأصبح مصطلح الدولة متداولاً أكثرَ في القرن التاسع عشر. وكان هناك تشابه بين مدلول النظام السياسي ومدلول نظام الحكم في الدولة، فقد كان نشاط السلطة في الماضي في ظل الدولة الحارسة محدوداً بحماية البلاد من الاعتداءات الخارجية، وضمان الأمن في الداخل وتحقيق سلامة المعاملات بين الأفراد بإقامة العدل بينهم، ولكن نشاط السلطة تطور وتدخلت السلطة في مجالات كانت محظورة عليها ومحجوزة للأفراد فاتسعت فكرة السلطة السياسية ودخلت فيها عناصر اجتماعية، ومدت السلطة نشاطها إلى المجال الاقتصادي وأصبحت توجه الاقتصاد وتسيطر عليه أحياناً وزاد نشاط السلطة بتدخلها في نشاط الأفراد والجوانب الثقافية وبذلك اختلف مدلول النظام السياسي عن نظام الحكم ففي حين يقتصر مدلول نظام الحكم على السلطات الثلاث الموجودة في الدولة فإن مدلول النظام السياسي يشمل نظام الحكم ومختلف القوى التي توجه نظام الحكم السياسي كالأحزاب السياسية والرأي العام والنقابات والإعلام. فهذه القوى تشكل في الوقت الحاضر قوى أساسية توجه المجتمع في الدولة لا يتوقف بقاء الوزارات في الحكم على ثقة البرلمان في الدولة إنما يتوقف على رضا الحكام المستترين، مثل النقابات وقوى الضغط ورأس المال في بعض المجتمعات. وقد تكلم أرسطو في كتابه السياسة عن المدينة ومقوماتها فبحث في الشعب والإقليم والسلطة السياسية من حيثُ أهدافها وأشكال الحكومات وبحث في النظم السياسية المختلفة وأسباب زوالها. وفي عهد الرومان جرى التمييز بين القانون الخاص والقانون العام وفقاً لمعيار شكلي هو ظهور الدولة باعتبارها سلطة عامة في الروابط القانونية. وبقي القانون الدستوري يدعى بالقانون العام. وأول من انتبه إلى خصوصيته هم الأساتذة الإيطاليون حيثُ تم إحداث كرسي لتدريس مادة القانون الدستوري بدءاً من عام 1797 في بعض الجامعات الإيطالية مثل "فيراري وباﭭي ويولونيا" ومن إيطاليا انتقلت التسمية إلى فرنسا حيثُ تم إحداث كرسي لمادة القانون الدستوري في كلية الحقوق في باريس عام 1834 ومنها انتشرت إلى دول العالم اللاتيني وإلى مصر ثم إلى الدول العربية. وقد تطور تدريس مادة القانون الدستوري في الجامعات الفرنسية وأصبح يشمل النظم السياسية المختلفة ومشاكلها الدستورية فصدر في فرنسا عام 1954 مرسوم استبدل مصطلح القانون الدستوري بمصطلح القانون الدستوري والنظم السياسية. وصدر في مصر عام 1956 قرار جمهوري باستبدال مصطلح القانون الدستوري بمصطلح القانون الدستوري والنظم السياسية وانتقل بعد ذلك إلى بقية الدول العربية. وقد انقسم الفقه الدستوري في دراسته لهذا الموضوع إلى اتجاهين: الأول يقدم موضوع القانون الدستوري ويتبعه بدراسة النظم السياسية، والاتجاه الثاني يقدم موضوع النظم السياسية أولاً ثم يقوم بدراسة مبادئ القانون الدستوري على اعتبار أن وجود الدولة أسبق على النظام الدستوري، ولا يخلو الأمر من اختلاف في وجهات النظر مبني على الاجتهاد والتبويب ولعل قائمة المراجع في نهاية الكتاب توضح ذلك.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=267691

263083	2	انقلابات تركيا من عدنان منديريس إلى رجب طيب أردوغان /	نور الدين، محمد.	أكدت المحاولة الإنقلابية الفاشلة في 15 تموز / يوليو 2016 على الرئيس التركي رجب طيب اردوغان، أن النزعة الإنقلابية العسكرية في تركيا لم تخمد، لكن البعد السياسي والخارجي لهذه المحاولة كان أكثر وضوحاً من الإنقلابات السابقة.    فمجموعة الضباط المتمردين لم تكن سوى أداة في حرب سياسية بين أردوغان والداعية الديني فتح الله غولين، ومن خلفه الولايات المتحدة الأميركية.    يلقي هذا الكتاب الضوء على مسار الصراع بين النزعتين العسكرية والسياسية في تركيا منذ الإنقلاب الأول عام 1960، ويعرض لأوجه أخرى من الإنقلابات المدنية المفتوحة التي شهدتها تركيا في ظل سلطة أردوغان.    ويتوقف الكتاب بالتفصيل عند مسار العلاقة بين الشريكين أردوغان - غولين، ومن ثم التطورات التي مهدت للإنفجار الكبير في 15 تموز / يوليو وتداعياته الداخلية والخارجية.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=263083

258912	2	المودودي و صناعة التجديد الإسلامي /	Nasr, Seyyed Vali Reza,	هذا الكتاب في الأصل هو أطروحة المؤلّف للدكتوراه عام 1994. ولي سيد نصر هو الآن عالم سياسي مبرّز وعميد كلية الدراسات السياسية والاستراتيجية التابعة لجامعة جون هوبكنز، ويعدّ من المتخصصين في سياسة الشرق الأوسط وثقافته، إذ إلى جانب تكوينه الأكاديمي هو من أصلي إيراني، هاجر وأبوه الفيلسوف سيد نصر إلى أميركا بعد الثورة الإيرانية 1979.    يستقصي المؤلف في هذا الكتاب، من خلال رحلة ميدانية وبحثية طويلة، سيرة أبي الأعلى المودودي؛ أحد أبرز منظّري الإسلام السياسي، الذي يراه المؤلف أبا الإسلام السياسي والمؤثر الأهم، ليس في شبه القارة الهندية فحسب، بل وحتى في المجال الشيعي الإيراني، من خلال الخميني، وفي المجال السني العربي، من خلال تأثّر حسن البنا وجماعة الإخوان المسلمين بأفكاره الشمولية التي ترجمها أبو الحسن الندوي مبكرًا.    حراك المودودي قبل انفصال باكستان وبعده هو ما يحاول أن يستقصيه هذا الكتاب، إذ يرسم الكتاب شخصية المودودي بنفَس أكاديمي موضوعي لا يخلو من بعض المفاجآت، ومن بينها إبراز براغماتية المودودي وتقلّباته طوال حراكه السياسي، على سبيل المثال يحكي المؤلف أن المودودي ألّف في شبابه كتابًا تبجيليلًا عن «غاندي»، ويحكي تقلّباته الأخرى قبل وبعد تأسيس «جماعة إسلامي»، غامزًا من أن تكوينه كان أقرب إلى الصحافي من العالِم، وموافقًا في هذا ما حكاه فضل الرحمن مالك الذي قال مبررًا خروجه من باكستان، بعد مضايقات المودودي وأتباعه له، «لا يستطيع العالِم أن يهزم صحافيًا»، وفي هذا السياق، يرى المؤلف أن المودودي تأثر ببعض أفكار السلفية الهندية ولم يكن مطّلعًا على أدبيات الدعوة السلفية النجدية (دعوة ابن عبد الوهاب).							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=258912

Following on from the centennial anniversary of the birth of the founding father (1918-2018), and when exploring the rise of this blessed country, its people and residents, we discover the late Sheikh Zayed dedicated his life to serving his homeland, overcoming challenges and achieving great progress with patience and determination. The book explores the upbringing and early life of Sheikh Zayed, as well as the various factors that shaped his character and thought, seeing him become an exceptional role model who left his mark on the history of the UAE, Gulf, Arab region and world. The book also charts Sheikh Zayed’s rule in the city of Al Ain, where early success was an indication of his leadership genius and sound approach to making the most of opportunities and addressing challenges. The book goes on to examine Sheikh Zayed’s time as ruler in Abu Dhabi, and the pivotal role he played in modernizing the emirate, which paved the way to seeing his dream of unification become a reality. The book examines Sheikh Zayed’s role in establishing the UAE Federation, highlighting several important aspects, including his views on the Union and the measures he took to overcome difficulties to achieve unity, and preserve it. Sheikh Zayed’s work to establish the Union, at constitutional and institutional levels, created a development model based on balance and sustainability; combining authenticity and modernity. The book also highlights the humanitarian aspect of Sheikh Zayed’s life, looking at his approach to humanitarian action and his countless charitable deeds. Sheikh Zayed’s foreign policy principles and objectives are also explored, as well as his achievements in promoting joint Gulf and Arab action, and his support of the Palestinian cause.

243489	6	زايد بن سلطان آل نهيان : | سيرة التحول والنهوض /	الشيخ، خليل	ينقسم إلى ثمانية فصول تسعى في مجموعها لرسم معالم شخصية الشيخ زايد الذي استطاع أن يبني أمة، ويصنع تحولاً حضارياً جذرياً يراه القاصي والداني. وأشار المؤلفان في تصديرهما للكتاب إلى أن شخصية الشيخ زايد تمثل لحظة التوازن بين الركائز الثابتة والعناصر المتحولة، فقد ظل من المتمسكين بالقيم والأخلاق والثوابت، كما ظل يدعو على الدوام إلى قيم الصدق والمروءة والإيثار والتراحم والتواد والعدل والإنصاف مثلما كان منفتحاً على قيم العصر المتمثلة بالحفاظ على حقوق الإنسان والإيمان بالحرية والتعددية والتسامح ورفض التمييز العنصري، لهذا لم يكن للهوية في نظره معطى ثابت، كما أنها لم تكن لحظة منغلقة بقدر ما تشكلت بوصفها ثمرة للحظة تفاعل منتج. وأنتجت الطبعة الخاصة لهذا الكتاب في دولة الإمارات، وتتميز بأنها ذات ميزات فنية عالية في الطباعة، أما لغته فجمعت بين العمق والبساطة لتخاطب في آن معاً الدارسين وعامة القراء، ولاسيما فئة الشباب مستثمرة جماليات الخط العربي. والكتاب يغوص عميقاً في فكر الشيخ زايد بمنهجية علمية تحليلية تقدم أفكار الشيخ زايد التي جمعت بين الأصالة والحداثة، ويتتبع أبرز معالمها وطبيعة تطورها. ويقارب الكتاب سيرة الشيخ زايد من منظور لحظتي التحول والنهوض، وهو منظور جوهري في حياة الشيخ زايد يكاد يختصر حركته في الزمان والمكان، ويؤدي إلى الكشف عن منظوره النهضوي الذي تمثل في قدرته على تحرير الطاقة المبدعة للفرد والمجتمع في دولة الإمارات، وزيادة فاعليته ويسعى الكتاب إلى تتبع مدارج الترقي في شخصية الشيخ زايد منذ طفولته وشبابه المبكر، وكيفية بنائه لوعيه الذي أسهم في إحداث التحول والنهوض. ويتدرج الكتاب في وصف رحلة الشيخ زايد، وصولاً إلى مرحلة بناء الدولة، مجسدة بذلك رمزاً لتحول مجتمعي شامل انتقل فيه المجتمع من حال إلى حال من دون أن يفقد أصالته، وظل الشيخ زايد على امتداد رحلته حريصاً على ثوابته والإفادة مما عند الآخرين من علم وتقدم لذا لم يستطع التحول أن يغير من جوهر شخصية الراحل الكبير الذي نشأ في بيئة يسكنها الإيمان الذي بقي ملازماً لفكرة التقدم عنده فكان يكثر من ترداد قوله تعالى «وما بكم من نعمة فمن الله» مثلما ظلت تجربته الفردية وثيقة الصلة بمجتمعها، وهي تحدث التحول وتبني النهضة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=243489

He employed his eloquence to promote enlightened ideas and promote adherence to noble moral standards. Not long after he assumed his position of leadership he earned the title ' Sage of the Arabs".							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=242875
242874	6	أصول الريادة الحضارية : | دراسة في فكر الشيخ زايد /	راغب،  نبيل،	استطاع الشيخ زايد -طيب الله ثراه- أن يحل المعادلة الصعبة التي تحتم الجمع بين الأصالة والمعاصرة، بفضل الرؤية الثاقبة والخيال الخصب الذي منحه القدرة على تحليل مكونات الواقع وحقائقه، ثم الانطلاق إلى آفاق المستقبل، وقد تمثلت الثوابت عند الشيخ زايد في قيم الدين الحنيف والمثل والإنسانية العليا والأخلاقيات التي من دونها يتحول المجتمع إلى غابة.  وقد تمثلت الريادة الحضارية للشيخ زايد في الأساليب الاستراتيجية التي اتبعها لتحقيق إنجازاته القومية، مثل إقامة "اتحاد الإمارات العربية". وأي باحث يتصدى لدراسة معنى القرارات الكبرى التي اتخذها الشيخ زايد سيجد أن الرابط المشترك لها هو تحرير الإرادة الوطنية، ووضع مصير الوطن في يد أبنائه، والحرص على مقومات الشخصية القومية، وذلك باعتماد تجربة حضارية لم تتوان عن الاستفادة من شتى التجارب والخبرات التي تصلح لتقدم الوطن، والرفض المطلق لتجميد هذه التجربة الحية في قوالب صماء.  إن أصول الريادة الحضارية في فكر الشيخ زايد مثل شجرة مثمرة وارفة الظلال، تمتد جذورها في أعماق تربة الوطن؛ لتستمد منها عصارة الحياة التي تسري في فروعها وأغصانها الشامخة التي تعلو فوق هامات السحاب.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=242874

204464	3	الأزمة المالية العالمية : | الاضطرابات السياسية و الاجتماعية /	وارهولا، جيمس	هناك علاقة بين الأزمة المالية العالمية التي اندلعت عام 2008 والاضطرابات السياسية والاجتماعية التي أعقبتها: فقد أحدثت الأزمة: بشكل غير مباشر: تغييراً جوهرياً في النظام السياسي في العديد من بلدان "الربيع العربي".   وإذا كان ثمة قاسم مشترك لأسباب الاضطرابات السياسية والاجتماعية: فهو غياب أو هامشية المساءلة السياسية للقيادات الوطنية؛ بالإضافة إلى فشل المجتمع الدولي في التدخل في حالات لا يكون فيها مثل هذا التدخل مبرَّراً أخلاقياً فحسب بل لازماً لأسباب براجماتية تتعلق بالحؤول دون تصعيد حدة النزاع.   ويؤكد المؤلف أنه يجب على الزعماء الدينيين أن يمارسوا دورهم في حل الاضطرابات الاجتماعية والسياسية: كما أن دور القيادة السياسية السليمة والفاضلة يُعدُّ أمراً بالغ الأهمية.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=204464
204463	3	أثر الأزمة المالية العالمية في قطاع التعليم /	هنتر، سوزان	لم ينجُ قطاع التعليم العالي: في كل من الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية وأوروبا وشرق آسيا: من تأثير الأزمة المالية العالمية عام 2008. وقد اتبعت كل الجامعات الأمريكية استراتيجيات عدة لمواجهة تخفيض الاعتمادات الحكومية والمنح الأهلية: ومحاولة الحفاظ على جودة التعليم. ومن الاستراتيجيات المهمة التوجه نحو التعليم عن طريق الإنترنت: ليس من أجل تقليل تكلفة التعليم فقط: بل لأن طريقة التعليم هذه ستصبح جزءاً رئيسياً من مشهد التعليم في المستقبل أيضاً. كما دفعت الأزمة المالية الجامعات إلى زيادة التفكير في تحسين الشفافية والمساءلة والإجراءات: ما سيؤدي إلى ممارسات أكثر كفاءة؛ وأن تنجز أكثر بأدوات أقل.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=204463
204462	3	الأزمة المالية العالمية وانعكاساتها على دول مجلس التعاون لدول الخليج العربية /	روبن، جوناثان	استطاعت دول مجلس التعاون ككل التأقلم وعلى نحو كافٍ مع الآثار السلبية للأزمة المالية بمعدل نمو متوقع لعام 2012 بلغ 6% للمنطقة.   و وفقاً لمؤسسة الخليج للاستثمار: فإن هذا التأقلم يعود إلى جملة واسعة من السياسات المالية التي تنفّذ مجموعة متنوعة من المشروعات الاستثمارية: والإنفاقات على البرامج الاجتماعية المحلية: واستقرار أسعار النفط.   والواضح أن تنويع اقتصادات دول مجلس التعاون يُعدّ هدفاً مهماً للحدّ من الاعتماد على الصادرات النفطية: وتجنب لعنة الموارد بفعل نمو غير متوازن. وقد وصل مجموع الدخل المتحقق من صادرات النفط في اقتصاد دول منظمة البلدان المصدّرة للنفط (أوبك) إلى 625 مليار دولار عام 2011: بعد أن كان 450 مليار دولار عام 2010: مع زيادة أخرى بنسبة 10% متوقعة لعام 2012.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=204462

204199	3	المواطنة و الحرية الدينية في الغرب : | تحليل مقارن لتجارب المسلمين في فرنسا و ألمانيا و الولايات المتحدة /	سالم، جاكلين	بدأت هجرة المسلمين إلى الغرب قبل قرنٍ من الزمن: وصارت تزداد بشكل ملحوظ منذ عام 1965. وقد أسفر هذا التوجه من جانب المسلمين للهجرة إلى الدول الغربية عن استيطان أعداد كبيرة من أفراد جاليات مسلمة؛ تشكل أقليات في دول عديدة في أوروبا وأمريكا الشمالية: وأدى هذا إلى خلق نزاعات وتوترات جديدة بين أبناء الدول المضيفة والأقليات المسلمة في مجالات الحياة المهنية والسياسية والتعليمية والاجتماعية. تُحلل هذه الورقة مفهومي المواطَنة citizenship والتعبير الديني religious expression في العالم عموماً: مع تركيز خاص على تجارب الأقليات المسلمة المهاجرة في فرنسا وألمانيا والولايات المتحدة. وتشكل هذه الدول عيِّنة ملائمة لدراسة وضع الجاليات المسلمة المختلفة: وتجارب هذه الأقليات في الغرب. والجدير ذكره أن تجارب هذه الأقليات المسلمة تشكلت بتأثير الخلفيات الثقافية والعرقية للمهاجرين وتاريخ بلدانهم: إلى جانب خلفيات الدول المضيفة وتاريخها							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=204199

204188	3	السياسة الأمريكية في الشرق الأوسط : | في الفترة الرئاسية الثانية لباراك أوباما /	كول، جوان	يواجه الرئيس الأمريكي باراك أوباما في فترة رئاسته الثانية مجموعة من القضايا المتعلقة بالشرق الأوسط مثل إيران وإسرائيل وفلسطين وآثار الاضطرابات السياسية العربية عام 2011: وكذلك الآثار المترتبة على تغير المناخ والطاقة الخضراء. وقد تظل بعض سياساته كما كانت عليه في فترة رئاسته الأولى دون تغيير يذكر: لكن تعيين جون كيري وزيراً للخارجية وتشاك هاجل وزيراً للدفاع في حكومته سوف يؤدي إلى حدوث بعض التغيرات. وبصورة خاصة: قد يتحول اهتمام الإدارة الأمريكية بعيداً عن الشرق الأوسط باتجاه آسيا.   وقد أعلن أوباما عن عزمه استكمال فك الارتباط العسكري مع الشرق الأوسط من خلال إنهاء الحرب المستمرة في أفغانستان: وسحب معظم القوات الأمريكية منها: وربما كلها: بحلول نهاية عام 2014. وبعد مرور العقد الأول من القرن الحادي والعشرين الذي كانت فيه الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية تمثل قوة تحوّل في سياسات الشرق الأوسط: رسم أوباما مساراً يتسم بالمزيد من الحذر والبراغماتية للعقد الثاني.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=204188

173048	3	العقلانية في سلوك التصويت الانتخابي  /	السديري، وليد بن نايف	تبحث هذه الدراسة في طبيعة العوامل التي تؤثر على قرارات تصويت الناخب: والتي يمكن التعبير عنها بالسؤال الأساسي: لماذا يصوت الناخب بالطريقة التي يصوت بها؟ فالإجابة غاية في التعقيد: نظراً للتشابك الكبير في العوامل والمتغيرات التي تحيط بسلوك الناخب وبعملية اتخاذه قرار التصويت. وتناقش هذه الدراسة ثلاثة اتجاهات نظرية رئيسية في دراسات أكاديمية علم السياسة الأمريكية تفسر سلوك التصويت: وهي: الاتجاه الاجتماعي: الذي يرى أن العوامل الاجتماعية لها التأثير الرئيسي على قرارات تصويت الناخب: حيث يصوت بناء على خيارات سياسية مسبقة اكتسبها من المحيط والفئة الاجتماعية التي ينتمي إليها؛ والاتجاه النفسي: الذي يرى أن العوامل النفسية لها التأثير الرئيسي على قرارات تصويت الناخب: حيث يصوت متأثراً بشعوره بالولاء الحزبي للحزب الذي ينتمي إليه؛ والاتجاه الاقتصادي: ويرى أن العوامل "العقلانية" تُسَيِّرْ قرارات تصويت الناخب: حيث يصوت وفق حسابات عقلانية لمصالحه الذاتية إلى الخيار الذي يحقق له أعظم فائدة.  ويثير الباحث سؤالاً مهماً حول الدراسات الأكاديمية العربية؛ إذ كيف يمكن لها أن تستفيد من التجربة الأكاديمية الأمريكية في تطوير دراسات علمية متخصصة في سلوك تصويت الناخب بالعالم العربي؟ ويحاول في هذه الدراسة تقديم مقترحات وتوصيات في هذا المجال: أهمها الاهتمام بدعم إنشاء مراكز وطنية متخصصة ومستقلة في الدول العربية للدراسات الانتخابية: تلتزم بمعايير الجودة العلمية: وتعكف على دراسة الأبعاد المتعلقة بعملية التصويت والانتخابات: وتطوير القوانين والإجراءات والتطبيقات الانتخابية بناء على أسس علمية. وهو ما يساهم في الارتقاء بهذه الآلية والممارسة لتحقيق أقصى غاياتها المأمولة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=173048

172219	3	تنظيم القاعدة : الرؤية الجيوسياسية و الاستراتيجية و البنية الاجتماعية /	الشيشاني، مراد بطل	الملخص :  ¦ يعد تنظيم القاعدة: الواجهة الأبرز للتيار السلفي الجهادي: من أبرز "الأطراف غير المنتمية للدولة" التي مارست العنف السياسي منذ مطلع الألفية الجديدة. ويصوَّر هذا التنظيم/ التيار بأنه مجرد مجموعة من المتطرفين الأغرار: ولكن أدبياته وسلوكه يؤكدان أنه يعبر عن رؤية جيوسياسية واستراتيجية تعد من صميم بنيته الفكرية والحركية.  يحلل هذا الكتاب نشاط التيار السلفي الجهادي: وتنظيم القاعدة بالضرورة: في مناطق مختلفة من العالم: وهي مناطق تحتوي على مزايا استراتيجية وجيوسياسية نسبية: وتلعب دوراً أساسياً في السياسات الدولية على المستويين السياسي والاقتصادي. وتشمل هذه المناطق شبه الجزيرة العربية: وبلاد الشام والرافدين: وأفريقيا: ومنطقة جنوب غربي آسيا: وآسيا الوسطى والقوقاز: والغرب.  كما أن الكتاب يسعى للإجابة عن تساؤل يرتبط بآليات التجنيد التي يتبعها التيار: وذلك من خلال تحليل البنية الاجتماعية لأعضاء التيار في المناطق المختلفة محل الدراسة. ويركز الكتاب في كل حالات الدراسة التي يقدمها على رصد أدبيات التيار نفسه وتحليلها: وعلى استقصاء أبرز القادة المؤثرين فكرياً وحركياً في التيار. وينشد الكتاب أخيراً استشراف التحولات التي قد تمس وجود التيار/ التنظيم وانتشاره نتيجة لعوامل مستجدة: ومن أهمها مقتل زعيمه أسامة بن لادن: وبروز الحراك الشعبي في العالم العربي المسمى "الربيع العربي".							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=172219

168915	6	أثر المؤسسات الإصلاحية و العقابية على النزلاء /	البريمي، عائشة إبراهيم،	أظهرت التجارب الإنسانية الدور الحيوي والفعال للسجن كمؤسسة عقابية في معالجة الجرائم في المجتمعات. كما وأثبتت أن عملية تطوير وسائل عمل السجون من الأمور الضرورية التي تساهم في تفادي الأضرار والآثار السلبية التي تتمخض عن حجز الحريات في بيئة مخصصة لضبط المجرمين ومعاقبتهم. وبما أن إدارة السجون المحلية وحراستها من اختصاصات هيئة الشرطة، فقد حرصت السياسة التشريعية الحديثة على إخضاع إدارة السجون لتنظيمين هما التنظيم الإداري والفني، واللذان يعتمدان على جهاز متخصص لتنفيذ سياسة العلاج وتيسير الخدمات للنزلاء وتنظيم شؤونهم اليومية.  لذا ارتأى مركز بحوث شرطة الشارقة القيام بإعداد دراسة خاصة بالمنشآت الإصلاحية والعقابية تحت عنوان "أثر المنشآت الإصلاحية والعقابية على النزلاء" والتي تنبثق أهميتها من خلال إلقائها الضوء على البرامج التأهيلية المختلفة التي تحرص المنشأة على تنظيمها ومدى أثرها في سلوكيات النزلاء إيجاباً أو سلباً.  ومن المعلوم أنه حتى تتم الاستفادة من الجهود والدراسات البحثية على أكمل وجهه، لا بد من تفعيل التوصيات التي تنتهي إليها الدراسات الميدانية والأخذ بها وذلك تحقيقا للتميز والجودة في الأعمال والاختصاصات التي تقوم بها إدارات الشرطة سواء في دولة الإمارات أم على المستوى العربي والدولي على حد سواء.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=168915

164706	6	الإمارات و سياسة الإتفاقيات البريطانية 1820-1853 /	العيدروس، محمد حسن،	أول ما نبدأ بالحمد لله حمداً كثيراً وثناء عظيماً والصلاة على نبيه الأمين وعلى ذريته الطاهرين .  اتجهت بريطانيا بعد نجاحها فى الاحتلال العسكرى للإمارات إلى السيطرة السياسية عن طريق عقد الاتفاقيات السياسية، والتحكم الاقتصادي بهدف منع أسس الاقتصاد الوطنى، ألا وهى التجارة البحرية مع الهند وشرق أفريقيا، والتي أدت فيما بعد إلى تدهورها والاعتماد فقط على اقتصاد اللؤلؤ .  هذا يعنى بأن الاحتلال العسكرى والتحكم السياسي عبر الاتفاقيات والسيطرة الاقتصادية كانت إجراءات أساسية في مفهوم وعقلية الاستعمار البريطاني، لأن بريطانيا ما كانت باستطاعتها أن تحكم قبضتها على الإمارات لهذه الفترة الطويلة من عام 1820 إلى 1971، إلا من خلال العنف العسكرى وفرض سياسة الاتفاقيات من أجل إبقاء سيطرتها لأطول فترة ممكنة .  وبذلك نجحت بريطانيا في تحطيم أسس المقاومة الإماراتية، وخاصة الداخلية وإقامة أسس التبعية الدائمة لتلك الفترة الطويلة، أي تحطيم المكونات العقدية وعمليات الجهاد البحرى الذى كان أبناء الإمارات يقومون به، إلى تدمير الأنماط المعيشية والإنتاجية التي كان يعمل من أجله من خلال التجارة وإحلال مكونات أخرى شكلت أساساً للتبعية الدائمة لبريطانيا، مما جعلته نموذجا جرى تطبيقه في بقية أقطار العربية الأخرى مثل : عمان والبحرين والكويت وقطر وحضرموت وعدن ومصر وغيرها .							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=164706
164705	6	‏الإمارات من المواجهات العسكرية إلى الإحتلال البريطاني، 1810-1819 /	العيدروس، محمد حسن،	أول ما نبدأ بالحمد لله حمداً كثيراً وثناءً عظيماً والصلاة على نبيه الأمين وعلى ذريته الطاهرين ،  أصبح الاحتلال البريطاني للإمارات وشيكا بعدما رأينا الحملات العسكرية البريطانية المتكررة على رأس الخيمة وفشلها في السنوات السابقة، مما يعنى أن بريطانيا سوف تعود بقوة عندما تسمح لها أوضاعها الداخلية في الهند، وتخلصها من منافسها التقليدى فرنسا بعد خسارتها في حرب السنوات السبع، ومن ثم اتفاقياتها مع كل من إيران وعمان إلى درجة أكبر من التحالف الإستراتيجي الكبرى .  كل ذلك سهل لإعداد الحملة العسكرية البريطانية الكبرى ضد الإمارات حيث الوضع الدولي والإقليمى كان مهيأ لهذه الحملة العسكرية، إضافة إلى مساعدة سلطان عمان الحليف القوى لبريطانيا لإعادة الشيخ سلطان صقر القاسمي إلى الحكم في الشارقة، علما بأن القوات السعودية كانت قد اعتقلته وأودعته في السجن أثناء زيارته لعاصمتها درعين، وعند مجيء الحملة المصرية وتدميرها للعاصمة السعودية، تمكن الشيخ سلطان صقر القاسمي من الهرب إلى عمان ومن هناك تم إعادته إلى الحكم بمساعدة سعيد سلطان عمان، ولا يمكن للشيخ سلطان صقر القاسمي أن ينسى هذا الجميل بعدما كان من أكبر أعداء عمان وبريطانيا، وقد حاربهم بشراسة لسنوات طويلة قبل اعتقاله من السعوديين .							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=164705

155378	6	عهد النماء و صناعة التفوق : | توثيق للأنشطة و الفعاليات السياسية و الاقتصادية و الاجتماعية و الثقافية التي قام بها الفريق أول سمو الشيخ محمد بن زايد آل نهيان ولي عهد أبوظبي نائب القائد الأعلى للقوات المسلحة رئيس المجلس التنفيذي من 26/11/2004 لغاية 27/6/2008 /		يسر مركز شؤون الإعلام أن يقدم هذا الكتاب الذي يوثق جهود وإنجازات الفريق أول سمو الشيخ محمد بن زايد آل نهيان ولي عهد أبوظبي نائب القائد الأعلى للقوات المسلحة، ويبين فيه بالاستقراء والتحليل مختلف جوانب العمل السياسي والتنفيذي التي أولاها اهتمامه الكبير.  ويشير الكتاب إلى أن سمو الشيخ محمد بن زايد آل نهيان استلهم حكمة الراحل الشيخ زايد طيب الله ثراه، واستنار برؤى وتوجيهات الخلف الصالح قائد المسيرة صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد آل نهيان رئيس الدولة ؛ لينطلق بخطى حثيثة وإرادة قوية لتحقيق ما اختطته الدولة وسعت إليه من أهداف نبيلة وما ارتضته وحافظت عليه من غايات سامية، من أجل تطوير واستحداث مخططات وبرامج الإدارة لتحقيق مكاسبها الوطنية وتعميق أبعادها الحضارية .  ويبين الكتاب أن سمو الشيخ محمد بن زايد آل نهيان في إطار حرصه على تنمية كافة المسارات الاقتصادية والاجتماعية والحضارية، أخذ على عاتقه أن يظل الارتقاء بقدرات الإنسان العلمية والعملية محوراً أساسياً لبناء الوطن، وتأكيداً لذلك يقول سموه : «إن الاهتمام بالإنسان هو الأساس الذي قامت عليه نهضة دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة وأن هذا الاهتمام لا يتوقف على الاحتياجات المادية الأساسية بل يتعداه إلى مدى أوسع يشمل فتح آفاق المعرفة والإبداع أمامه بحيث يكون مشاركاً قوياً وفاعلاً في إيجاد حلول ناجعة للقضايا التي يواجهها العالم .  وتبياناً لأوجه المتابعة من جانب سموه لكافة تفاصيل الأداء الحكومي وسير المرافق العامة وأساليب ووسائل إتاحة خدماتها للمتعاملين معها من أبناء الوطن والمقيمين على أرضه الطيبة، يرصد الكتاب اجتماعات المجلس التنفيذي لإمارة أبوظبي، ويبرز أهم القرارات المتعلقة بمجالات توفير خدمات التعليم والصحة والإسكان والماء والكهرباء.  ويعرض لكثير من أنماط الرعاية الشاملة التي يوليها سموه للأداء الحكومي المتميز وما يخلقه من تنافسية وتجويد وإجادة من خلال الجوائز التقديرية والتشجيعية، وتعبيراً عن هذا الطموح يؤكد سمو ولي عهد أبوظبي أن تطوير الأداء الحكومي للدوائر والمؤسسات والهيئات الحكومية كافة يعد من أهم مرتكزات تحقيق الرؤية الإستراتيجية لأبوظبي لإحداث طفرة تنموية شاملة ومستدامة». ويقول سموه: «إن إعلاء وتقدير قيمة التميز في أداء القطاع الحكومي يعكس حرص القيادة الحكيمة برئاسة صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد آل نهيان رئيس الدولة على الأخذ بأفضل الأساليب في حقل إدارة الموارد البشرية والارتقاء بقدراتها الإنتاجية مما يجعل هذا القطاع قادراً على التعامل مع متطلبات التنمية الشاملة واستحقاقات التطور الكبير الذي تشهده إمارة أبوظبي في الميادين كافة .  ويرصد الكتاب عدداً من المشروعات والمبادرات الاقتصادية العملاقة التي انطلقت في أبوظبي ترسيخاً لمكانتها المرموقة عالمياً كمنارة حضارية وقلعة صناعية، وسيراً بها إلى آفاق أرحب من التنمية والانفتاح، تمكنها من مواكبة تطورات العصر والتفوق عليها وهذا ما يؤكده سمو الشيخ محمد بن زايد بقوله : «إن إمارة أبوظبي تشهد مرحلة تحول كبيرة اقتصادياً ترتكز على رؤية طموحة ترمي إلى جعل اقتصادها أكثر انفتاحاً واستجابة وتفاعلاً مع تطورات الاقتصاد العالمي . مضيفاً في تصريح لسموه بمناسبة افتتاح مدينة أبوظبي الصناعية الثانية إننا نتحرك نحو المستقبل بطموح وثقة لتعزيز مكانة الدولة على المستوى العالمي في جعل البيئة الاقتصادية في أبوظبي الخيار الأفضل للمستثمرين من خلال تطوير البنية التحتية الأساسية وإنشاء المناطق الصناعية المتخصصة وإيجاد البيئة الاستثمارية المحفزة والقادرة على اجتذاب الاستثمارات الأجنبية» . .  ويستعرض جوانب رعاية سمو ولي عهد أبوظبي للعمل الثقافي والفكري ذي المردودات الإنسانية والحضارية الراقية، مشيراً في هذا السياق إلى اتخاذ الخطوات العملية لإنشاء متحف اللوفر أبوظبي بالتعاون مع الجمهورية الفرنسية، ومتحف «جوجنهايم» بالتعاون مع جمهورية ألمانيا الاتحادية، والاتفاق على إنشاء جامعة نيويورك أبوظبي في جزيرة السعديات لتكون مركزاً للعلوم الإنسانية والاجتماعية، ووضع حجر الأساس للمرحلة الأولى للمقر الدائم لجامعة السوربون باريس «أبوظبي».							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=155378

154686	3	العراق والامبراطورية الامريكية : | هل يستطيع الامريكيون العرب التأثير في السياسة الامريكية في الشرق الاوسط ؟ /	الخالدي، رشيد،	في كتابه الأخير انبعاث إمبراطورية سعى رشيد الخالدي لإثبات أن الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية بغزوها للعراق إنما تقتدي، عن قصد أو دون قصد بالنهج الذي تنبته الإمبراطوريات الأوروبية الاستعمارية في الشرق الأوسط، ولنا جميعاً أن نحكم بأنفسنا إن كان التاريخ قد أعاد نفسه حقاً في العراق حين نرى في دونالد رامسفيلد وزلماي خليل زاد صورتين معاصرتين لكل من ونستون تشرتشل والسير بيرسي كوكس، على التوالي. وعلى أية حال، فليس هذا هو الموضوع الرئيسي للبحث في هذا الكراس فهو بدلاً من ذلك يعرض تقييماً لبعض التداعيات الدولية الأوسع نطاقاً للغزو طيلة السنوات الثلاث التي أعقبت الاحتلال الأمريكي للعراق، ليتناول بشكل موجز التأثير الذي يمكن للعرب الأمريكيين إحداثه، على ضآلته، في صياغة السياسة الأمريكية في الشرق الأوسط واحتمالات تطوره مستقبلاً.    ويبدو أن غزو العراق واحتلاله قد جاء ليؤشرا بداية مرحلة جديدة من مراحل الهيمنة الأمريكية على العالم، سواء جاز للمرء أو لم يجز له أن يطلق وصف "الإمبراطورية" على هذه المرحلة. فهي تختلف جوهرياً عما سبقها من صيغ مبكرة لهذه الهيمنة اليت أفرزتها الحرب العالمية الثانية، والتي كانت تمارس عموماً بصورة غير مباشرة أو من خلال تحالفات متعددة الأطراف أو نظم حاكمة محلية، وبعض هذه الأخيرة يتم تنصيبه نتيجة تداخلات أمريكية، سواء في الخفاء أو العلن، وتتخذ أشكالاً عدة منها تمويل نشاطات الحركات المعادية للأحزاب الشيوعية في أوربا الغربية، ومنها تدريب ضباط عسكريين تمهيداً لاستيلائهم على السلطة في دول منطقتي أمريكا اللاتينية وشرق آسيا وغيرهما. وبرغم ذلك، وفي خارج إطار البيئة "التقليدية" للتدخلات الاستعمارية الأمريكية في مناطق حوض الكاريبي وأمريكا الوسطى والفلبين إثر الحرب الإسبانية-الأمريكية عام 1898، فإن الحكومات المحلية المشار إليها لم تكن تقام عموماً نتيجة غزو لبلدان هذه المناطق واحتلالها وإعادة بنائها ابتداءً من نقطة الصفر على أيدي الأمريكيين، وهو ما كانت القوى الاستعمارية تفعله في عموم أرجاء الأرض على امتداد القرن التاسع عشر ومطلع القرن العشرين، وهو أيضاً ما أريد القيام به في العراق بعد غزوه واحتلاله في آذار/مارس 2003. ومن هنا، فإن هذه الحرب إنما تمثل منطلقاً جديداً في عصر هيمنة أمريكا على العالم التي لا ينازعها عليها أحد منذ انتهاء الحرب العالمية الثانية والحرب الباردة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=154686

154664	3	الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية وأوربا في الشرق الأوسط وخارجه : | شركاء أم متنافسون ؟ /	كوبتشان، تشارلز،	لقد ثبت أن التعامل مع قضايا الشرق الأوسط طوال العقود الماضية كان من الأمور التي تسبب الخلاف الحاد بين الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية وأوروبا، ففي عهد الحرب الباردة، احتدم الجدل عبر الأطلسي حول عدد من القضايا؛ مثل: قناة السويس، والصراع الفلسطيني-الإسرائيلي، واحتواء إيران. ومع ذلك، لم تفسد هذه الخلافات العلاقات عبر الأطلسية؛ نظراً إلى التضامن الذي جمع تلك البلدان، في وجه التهديد السوفيتي، الذي كان ماثلاً أمامهم في أوروبا. وبأفول نجم الاتحاد السوفيتي، لم تعد سُحب المهمات المشتركة تخفي بظلالها، الخلافات السائدة في المناطق الأخرى.  تتبع الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية نهجاً، تختلف فيه عن أوروبا، فيما يتعلق بمسألة إحلال الديمقراطية في الشرق الأوسط. وتعود جذور الخلاف في هذا النهج، إلى الاختلاف العميق في الثقافة السياسية لدول جانبي الأطلسي. وقد تكون رغبة الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية في إحلال الديمقراطية منطلقة من مثالية بالغة، إلا أنها محدودة -أيضاً- بانعزالية قوية. فالولايات المتحدة الأمريكية تختار النأي بنفسها عن العالم تجنباً للمخاطر والتسويات. والسياسة الأمريكية لا يناسبها الإيقاع البطيء للتغير التدريجي، ولا الأعباء المرهقة لبناء الأمم، ولا غموض الثقافات الأجنبية، وفهم تقاليدها.  لكن أوروبا لا تجد نفسها -بأي حال من الأحوال- مدفوعة بمثل هذه الانعزالية؛ لوضع حلول سريعة. فأوروبا تفضل في الواقع، التحوّل التدريجي والمتأني إلى الديمقراطية. كما يفضل الأوروبيون إشراك الدول المستهدفة، لا عزلها؛ فيتحقق بذلك التحوّل السياسي التدريجي، بدلاً من التغيير المفاجئ لنظام الحكم. كما استغرقت الديمقراطية التحررية -بالضبط- أجيالاً عدة حتى تمكنت من تثبيت جذورها في أوروبا الغربية، فإن الاتحاد الأوروبي يتذرع الصبر، في تحقيق أهدافه الرامية إلى تصدير نموذجه شرقاً وغرباً.  وعلى الرغم من التوتر المزمن، الذي طبع العلاقات عبر الأطلسي حول الشرق الأوسط، فقد ظهرت بعض مؤشرات التقارب مؤخراً، وعلى الرغم من بقاء الوضع في العراق مفتقداً الاستقرار والوضوح، فإن كلا الطرفين على شاطئي الأطلسي، يبدو مستعداً لوضع خلافاته الحادة، حول الحرب خلف ظهره. أما حول ما يتعلق بإيران، فإن هناك تنسيقاً مشتركاً بين الترويكا الأوروبية (المملكة المتحدة، وفرنسا، وألمانيا) وبين واشنطن بشأنه، منذ أوائل عام 2005.  ولكن، على الرغم من المؤشرات الأخيرة التي تدل على حدوث مثل هذا التقارب، فمازالت الخلافات حول الشرق الأوسط موجودة بين هذه الدول على جانبي الأطلسي، ولا أمل في زوالها. وهي تشتد تارة، وتضعف أخرى، بحسب التطورات السلبية أو الإيجابية التي تشهدها المنطقة. ونظراً إلى تغلغل جذور هذه الخلافات في التجارب التاريخية على اختلافها، وفي الثقافات والمنظومات السياسية، من المحتمل أن تبقى هذه الخلافات حول سياسة الشرق الأوسط، كما هو شأنها في الماضي، مصدراً رئيساً للتوتر عبر الأطلسي مستقبلاً.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=154664
154662	3	نهوض الهند /	داس، جورشاران،	رغم أن النجاح الاقتصادي الذي تحقق في الهند ليس أمراً جديداً فإن العالم لم يكتشفه إلا مؤخراً. فبعد أن حقق هذا الاقتصاد نمواً بطيئاً في العقود الثلاثة التي تلت الاستقلال، ارتفعت وتيرة النمو السنوية لتبلغ 6% خلال الفترة 1980-2002، ثم وصلت إلى 7.5% سنوياً في الفترة 2002-2006، وبذلك أصبح الاقتصاد الهندي واحداً من أفضل اقتصادات العالم أداءً خلال ربع قرن. وقد تضاعف حجم الطبقة الوسطى إلى أربعة أمثاله خلال العقدين الماضيين (إذ أصبحت تضم نحو 250 مليون إنسان)، ويتخطى 1% من السكان خط الفقر كل عام، وفي الوقت نفسه انخفض معدل نمو السكان إلى 1.7% في الوقت الحاضر بعد أن وصل رقماً قياسياً هو 2.2% سنوياً قبل ذلك، وهذا يعني ارتفاع معدل الدخل الفردي من 1178 دولاراً إلى 3051 دولاراً منذ عام 1980 (بمعيار القوة الشرائية). ويعد الاقتصاد الهندي حالياً رابع أكبر اقتصاد في العالم، ومن المتوقع أن يتقدم على الاقتصاد الياباني ليحتل المركز الثالث عالمياً.    ولا تكمن أهمية ارتقاء الاقتصاد الهندي في حداثة عهده، وإنما في المسار الفريد الذي سلكه. فبدلاً من إتباع الاستراتيجية الآسيوية التقليدية المتمثلة في تصدير السلع الرخيصة الثمن التي يعتمد تصنيعها على استخدام أعداد كبيرة من الأيدي العاملة إلى الغرب، اعتمدت الهند على أسواقها المحلية أكثر من اعتمادها على التصدير، وعلى الاستهلاك بدلاً من الاستثمار، وعلى الخدمات بدلاً من التصنيع، وأخيراً على الإنتاج باستخدام التقنية المتقدمة بدلاً من الاعتماد على الأيدي العاملة القليلة المهارة.  وكان من نتائج تبني هذا الأسلوب أن بقي الاقتصاد الهندي في الغالب بمأمن من التقلبات العالمية، وأظهر قدراً مثيراً للإعجاب من الاستقرار لا يقل أهمية عن نسبة توسعه. فضلاً عن ذلك يعد هذا النموذج القائم على الاستهلاك أكثر قرباً من الناس مقارنة باستراتيجيات التنمية الأخرى. وكان من نتائج ذلك انخفاض درجة الفوارق في الهند مقارنة بالدول نقطة على مؤشر جيني -وهو مقياس للتفاوت في الدخل يتدرج من صفر إلى 100 -مقارنة بـ41 في الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية و45 في الصين و59 في البرازيل). وبالإضافة إلى ذلك فإن ما يعادل 30-40% من النمو في الناتج المحلي الإجمالي يعود سببه إلى زيادة الإنتاجية لا الزيادة في حجم رأس المال أو العمل، ويعد هذا دليلاً حقيقياً على متانة الاقتصاد وتقدمه.  غير أن أكثر ما يلفت النظر في نهوض الهند هو أنه لم يتحقق بدعم من الدولة، وإنما تحقق على الرغم من الدولة. ومن الواضح أن قصة النجاح الهندية ترتكز بشكل أساسي على المبادرات الاقتصادية الخاصة، غذ تفتخر الهند حالياً بوجود شركات خاصة على قدر عال من التنافسية، وبوجود سوق مزدهرة للأسهم والسندات، وقطاع مالي عصري ومنضبط ذاتياً. ومنذ عام 1991 بدأت الدولة الهندية تبتعد تدريجياً عن الساحة، بعد أن اضطرت مرغمة إلى تطبيق بعض الإصلاحات الاقتصادية. فقد رفعت العوائق التجارية، وخفضت نسب الضرائب، وكسرت الاحتكارات الحكومية، وفكت قيود الصناعة، وشجعت المنافسة، وانفتحت على باقي العالم، صحيح أن هذه الإصلاحات كانت بطيئة، ولكنها بدأت تتراكم وتؤتي ثمارها.  ومن المؤكد أن الهند مقبلة على نقطة مفصلية في تاريخها. فمن المحتمل جداً أن هذا النمو السريع سوف يستمر، بل سيتسارع، غير أنه لا يمكن للهند أن تعتبر هذا أمراً مفروغاً منه. فالدين العام مرتفع بقدر م لا يشجع على اسلاتثمار في مشروعات البنية التحتية التي تمس الحاجة إليها. كما أن لقوانين العمل الصارمة تأثيراً سلبياً يحول دون قيام أصحاب العمل. باستخدام أيد عاملة جديدة، رغم أن هذه القوانين بمجملها لا تغطي أكثر من 10% من القوة العاملة. ولا يزال القطاع العام كبيراً جداً وتعوزه الكفاءة، مع أنه أصغر بكثير من مثيله الصيني، مما يشكل عائقاً في وجه النمو والتوظيف وعبئاً على المستهلك. ورغم نجاح الهند في إنتاج سلع ذات مواصفات عالية تعتمد على رؤوس أموال كبيرة ومعرفة واسعة، فإنها أخفقت في تحقيق ثورة صناعية ذات قاعدة عريضة وتعتمد على تشغيل أعداد كبيرة من الأيدي العاملة، وهذا يعني أن المكاسب المتحققة في مجال التوظيف لم تكن متناسبة مع النمو العام. وفي الوقت ذاته يعاني السكان في المناطق الريفية تبعات نمط الإنتاج المعتمد على الدولة، وكذلك سوء التوزيع في مجال الزراعة، مما يتسبب في حصول الفلاحين على ما يزيد على 20-30% من أثمان بيع الفواكه والخضراوات بالتجزئة (مقارنة بالفلاحين في الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية الذين يحصلون على 40-50% من تلك الأثمان).							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=154662
154655	3	اللوبي الإسرائيلي و السياسة الخارجية الأمريكية /	ميرشايمر، جون	يصف الكتاب اللوبي بأنه تحالف واسع بين الأفراد والمنظمات التي تعمل بنشاط لتوجيه السياسة الأمريكية الخارجية إلى اتجاه مؤيد لإسرائيل.   ويركز الكتاب بشكل رئيسي على تأثير اللوبي على السياسة الأمريكية الخارجية وتأثيرها السلبي على مصالح أمريكا، ويقول الكاتبان أن تأثير اللوبي كان ضار لإسرائيل أيضاً بدون قصد.   يقول الكاتبان أنه بالرغم من أنه لا يمكن تحديد حدود اللوبي الإسرائيلي بشكل واضح إلا أن لها نواة تتكون من منظمات تهدف إلى تشجيع الحكومة الأمريكية والرأي العام الأمريكي على تزويد إسرائيل بالمساعدات المادية ودعم سياسات حكومتها، وكذلك الشخصيات المؤثرة التي تتخذ من هذه الأهداف أولويات لها. ويشير الكاتبان إلى أنه ليس كل أمريكي لديه مواقف محابية لإسرائيل هو جزء من اللوبي، وأن هناك الكثير من اليهود الأمريكيين لا ينتمون إلى اللوبي اليهودي بالرغم من أن الجزء الأكبر من اللوبي يتألف منهم، بالإضافة إلى المسيحيين الصهيونيين. ويزعمان أيضاً أن مجموعات مهمة في اللوبي انجرفت إلى اليمين وتداخلت مع المحافظين الجدد  في مقدمة التقرير يرى المؤلفان أنه:  "ينبغي أن تحظى المصلحة القومية الأمريكية بالصدارة المطلقة في أولويات السياسة الخارجية الأمريكية. إلا انه وعلى امتداد الفترة الزمنية الماضية، ولا سيما منذ حرب يونيو/ حزيران من عام ،1967 ظلت علاقة الولايات المتحدة ب “إسرائيل” هي حجر الزاوية في سياسة الولايات المتحدة الشرق أوسطية. وأدت المزاوجة بين سياسة الدعم المتواصل وغير المحدود من أمريكا ل‍”إسرائيل“، وبين السعي لنشر الديمقراطية في أرجاء المنطقة، إلى إلهاب مشاعر السخط في أوساط الرأي العام العربي والإسلامي، وهددت أمن الولايات المتحدة".    يزعم ميرشايمر ووالت أنه لم يتمكن أي لوبي من تحويل السياسة الأمريكية الخارجية عن المصالح الأمريكية القومية، وفي الوقت ذاته يقوم بإقناع الأمريكيين بأن مصالح الولايات المتحدة وإسرائيل متطابقة في الأساس. ويقولان أن اللوبي لا يختلف في عملياتهم الأساسية عن الجماعات ذات المصالح مثل اللوبي الزراعي وعمال الصلب والنسيج، واللوبيات الإثنية الأخرى. وما يميز اللوبي الإسرائيلي عنهم هو فعاليته الغير عادية. ويرى ميرشايمر ووالت أن التحالف الفضفاض الذي يشكل اللوبي يملك ورقة ضغط قوية على السلطة التنفيذية، بالإضافة إلى قدرته على التأكيد على أن منظور اللوبي حول إسرائيل ينعكس في وسائل الإعلام الرئيسية في نطاق واسع. ويزعم الكاتبان أن الايباك على وجه الخصوص لديه سلطة تامة على الكونغرس الأمريكي بسبب قدرتها على مكافأة المشرعين وأعضاء الكونغرس المرشحين الذين يدعمون أجندتها ومعاقبة أولئك الذين يتحدونها.  واستنكر ميرشايمر ووالت ما يسميانه سوء استخدام تهمة معاداة السامية وقالا أن الجماعات الموالية لإسرائيل تضع أهمية كبيرة على السيطرة على النقاش في الأوساط الأكاديمية الأمريكية، لكنهم في الوقت نفسه يعملون على نجاح اللوبي في حملته للقضاء على نقد إسرائيل في الحرم الجامعي. ويختم الكاتبان بأنه إذا نجح اللوبي في تشكيل السياسة الخارجية للولايات المتحدة في الشرق الأوسط، فإن عدو إسرائيل سيضعف أو يطاح به، وتسيطر إسرائيل على فلسطين، ثم تقوم أمريكا بأغلب العمل المتمثل في القتال والموت وإعادة البناء والدفع.  يصف البحث الحوادث والأرقام والأسماء المتعلقة بالنشاط اللوبي الإسرائيلي في الولايات المتحدة، وما يضم من أفراد ومنظمات ومؤسسات تعمل لتوجيه السياسة الخارجية الأمريكية لمصلحة إسرائيل. من المنظمات التي يركز عليها اللجنة الأمريكية - الإسرائيلية للشؤون العامة ومؤتمر رؤساء المنظمات اليهودية والمؤتمر اليهودي العالمي ومنتدى السياسة الإسرائيلية.   كما يشير الكتاب طرق عمل هذا اللوبي في الضغط على الكونغرس الأمريكي وعلى السلطة التنفيذية، والحيلولة دون تمكين التعليقات التي تنتقدها من اجتذاب آذان صاغية في الساحة السياسية. كما أن أحد الأسلحة الأقوى التي يستعملها اللوبي تهمة معاداة السامية التي يوصم بها كل من يتعرض لتصرفاتهم.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=154655

141270	6	دراسات في آثار و تراث دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة /	العبودي، ناصر حسين،	يبحث هذا الكتاب في ماضي دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة منذ أقدم العصور الحضارية حتى قبل هذه الأيام بسنين معدودة. وقد تعارف العلماء على تسمية العلم الذي يبحث العصور الحضارية القديمة بعلم الآثار، أما العلم الذي يبحث حياة الشعوب الاجتماعية والاقتصادية وطريقة حياتهم من مدة قصيرة نوعا ما بعلم التراث أو «الفلكلور» الشعبي.  ودولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة تبذل الآن جهداً كبيراً ومتميزاً للاهتمام بتراثها الحضاري القديم، وفي سبيل ذلك أنشأت مراكز ومؤسسات رسمية متخصصة عديدة مهمتها الأساسية تسجيل وبحث هذا التراث والاهتمام به دراسياً وحقلياً.  وهذا الكتاب عبارة عن دراسات موثقة في آثار وتراث الإمارات العربية المتحدة، هذه الدولة الحديثة التي ظهرت على مسرح التاريخ في الثاني من ديسمبر عام ١٩٧١م.  إن اهتمام الإمارات بآثارها القديمة، اهتمام قديم وترجع بداياته إلى أوائل الخمسينيات من هذا القرن في إمارة أبوظبي، حين دعا حاكمها آنذاك البعثة الدنماركية العاملة بالتنقيبات الأثرية في البحرين، وقبلها في الكويت، لزيارة أبوظبي لإلقاء نظرة على بعض المباني القديمة الملاحظة في جزيرة أم النار وبعض مناطق مدينة العين.  حيث فحصت البعثة هذه الآثار وتأكدت أنها تعود إلى فترات قديمة جداً وقد قامت البعثة أيضا بزيارة مختلف الإمارات حتى منطقة دبا على الساحل الشرقي وأعلنت أن بالإمارات الكثير من الشواهد الأثرية والتي تحتاج إلى تنقيب للكشف عن محتوياتها. ثم بدأت البعثة بعد سنين بالتنقيب عن الآثار وتوالت البعثات الأخرى وزاد الاهتمام بهذا المرفق من الحكومة الإتحادية ثم الحكومات المحلية.  أما التراث الشعبي فهو اهتمام آخر في نفس السلسلة الحضارية. وإذا كانت الآثار تحسب بآلاف ومئات السنين فإن علم التراث يبحث حياة شعب ما في حدود قرن من الزمان وربما أقل. وقد زاد اهتمام الدولة والمسؤولين والمواطنين بتراثهم الحضاري في السنين الأخيرة. ومرد ذلك أن التنمية الحديثة والتطور السريع أنسى الناس تراثهم. وبدأ يتلاشى شيئا فشيئا، بعد أخذ الحكومة والشعب الأساليب الحديثة في الحياة. لذلك يلاحظ أن الدولة ومواطنيها بدأوا يعطون التراث الشعبي والمحافظة عليه قدر المستطاع الاهتمام الأكبر فكثر الشعراء الشعبيون والمعارض التي تجسد التراث الشعبي الماضي الإمارات وعملت المهرجانات والسباقات التقليدية البحرية منها والبرية، بهدف المحافظة عليه وإعطاء الهوية القديمة الصادقة لهذه الدولة. وظهر عدد من الباحثين في تراث الإمارات من المواطنين والعرب لتسجيل ودراسة هذا التراث واستخلاص الماضي العريق والعبر منه.  أما على المستوى التنظيمي، فإن الدولة أنشأت بعض المراكز المهتمة بالتراث، لجان التاريخ والتراث في مختلف الإمارات، ومراكز أخرى صناعية للمحافظة على الصناعات التقليدية، واستخدمت الخبراء في هذا الحقل. وقد تطور الاهتمام بالتراث إلى إنشاء مركز طبي متخصص للعلاج بالطرق التقليدية القديمة، إضافة إلى مركز الأبحاث التراث يتبع جامعة الإمارات في مدينة العين. وقد دخلت دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة مشاركا رئيسيا على المستوى الخليجي للاهتمام بالتراث، حيث وقعت على وثائق تأسيس مركز التراث الشعبي لدولة الخليج العربية والذي يقع مقره الرئيسي في الدوحة بدولة قطر، إيمانا منها بأهمية التراث، وأن التراث الخليجي يشترك في معظم عناصره الأساسية والذي هو جز أيضا من التراث العربي الإسلامي، وأن التراث يجب أن يتولاه ويبحث فيه من هو مؤهل تأهيلا علميا متخصصا. وليس فيه مكان للاجتهاد كما كان في الماضي.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=141270

140027	6	تصريحات صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد آل نهيان التي أدلى بها لوسائل الإعلام منذ انعقاد قمة مجلس التعاون الأولى في أبو ظبي بتاريخ 25 مايو 1981 /		إن أبرز ما أكدته تجليات هذا العصر من تطورات وإنجازات متعاظمة، ليتجسد في إعلاء قيمة الوحدة والتكتل، سواء ما تعلق منها بالأطر والأنظمة السياسية، أو بالكيانات والتجمعات الاقتصادية والأمنية، حيث بات التكتل طريق المجابهة الأوحد لكل ما أفرزه ذلك العصر من تداعيات مؤكدة، ولكل ما أسفر عنه من إشكاليات معقدة.  ولم تكن حكمة قادة دول منطقة الخليج العربية بغافلة عن إدراك الأهمية القصوى لوحدتها المنشودة منذ أمد بعيد، فبالرغم من أن العلاقات الثنائية الوثيقة التي كانت تجمع بين الأشقاء ودولهم قد وفرت أساساً متيناً لصلات تعاون وشيجة في شتى المجالات عبر التاريخ الممتد، إلا أن أمل الوحدة ظل هدفاً لا يتزعزع؛ إدراكاً لما تؤديه هذه الوحدة من تعميق وتطوير للتعاون القائم، وتنسيق للسياسات والتوجهات في مختلف المجالات والميادين، صوناً وتعزيزاً للأمن، وسعياً للتقدم والرقي بما يكفله من رخاء ورفاهة للمواطنين، وعزة وقوة لدولهم المتحدة.  ومثل إيمان والدنا المغفور له صاحب السمو الشيخ زايد بن سلطان آل نهيان . رحمه الله وطيب ثراه - بحتمية وحدة الكلمة بين دول الخليج العربي، وحتمية تعاونها وتآزرها، دافعاً قوياً للسعي الجاد إلى تجسيد البناء الوحدوي الخليجي المتكامل فدائماً ما أعلن عن هذه الرغبة الملحة، ولم تفته مناسبة إلا وأكد على ضرورة صيرورتها حقيقة واقعة فكان - رحمه الله - يقول : إيماني قائم بأن يكون هذا الخليج كله موحدا ، فالوحدة أو الاتحاد قوة من غير شك ، ورغبتنا أن يكون الخليج وليس نحن فقط في صيغة وحدوية أو اتحادية لأجل أن يظل قوياً منيعا ، واتحادنا هنا ، هو من وحي هذا الأمل، حتى تكون هذه القوة قادرة أن تؤدي واجبها بين أشقائها في وقت نحتاج جميعاً إلى أداء هذا الواجب ضمن شعورنا بأن الوحدة هي إيمان، وهو إيمان موجود في قلب كل مخلص، في قلب كل مسؤول يعرف أن الوحدة قوة، وأن التفرق ضعف». فتحقق بالجهد المثابر ما تاقت إليه نفسه الخيرة، وأضحى الأمل واقعاً معاشاً تشهد بتفرده عظمة إنجازاته.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=140027

139893	6	فلسفة النفط في فكر صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد آل نهيان رئيس الدولة /		إن استرجاع الحقوق الوطنية في الثروة النفطية هو أول ما وجه إليه صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد اهتمامه وصرف إليه عنايته فانعكس ذلك في الاتفاقات التي عقدت مع كبريات شركات النفط العالمية حرصا على المصالح العليا للبلاد وتمسكا أصيلا بسيادتها التي لا تقبل المساومة على قرارات التنقيب والإنتاج والتصنيع. وأبرزت الدراسة الاهتمام المبكر والعناية الكبيرة التي أولاها صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد لوضع استراتيجية بعيدة المدى في مجال النفط والغاز بما يستجيب للطموحات الوطنية ويتماشى وتطورات الأوضاع العالمية. ووقفت عند فلسفة سموه الطاقوية وما ترتكز عليه من شمولية في التقييم وعلمية في التحليل وواقعية في التعاطي مع متطلبات التنمية الذاتية ومسؤوليات الإسهام في إرساء السلم والاستقرار الدوليين. وأوضح سمو الشيخ سلطان بن زايد آل نهيان في تقديمه للدراسة أبعاد ورهانات ومردودات هذه الفلسفة فقال سموه : في حياة الأمم والشعوب مهمات تختار رجالها وأدوار تنتقي أبطالها ولحظات لا تستمد عظمتها وتاريخيها من حجم المنجز وإنما أيضا من عبقرية المنجز وأن التنمية والبناء يظلان أكبر تحد بالنسبة لأية دولة وأعتى معترك يتصدى له أي شعب وأصعب اختبار يواجهه أي قائد ذلك أن كسب معركتهما أو الفشل فيها هو الذي يحدد حكم التاريخ الفيصل على الرجال والأعمال.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=139893
139892	6	خليفة بن زايد .. بناء و تنمية : | صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد آل نهيان رئيس دولة الامارات العربية المتحدة /		شكل المسار الاقتصادي الذي سارت عليه دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة نموذجاً فريداً بما حمله من طموحات، وما حققه من إنجازات.  فقد أعطى هذا المسار الجهد الإنساني كل معانيه ومنح إرادة الفعل أشمل مدلولاتها. وجعل هدف الاقتصاد هو الإنسان . فحقق معجزة سابقت الزمن وغالبت العصر، مما انعكس في مشهد الدولة الحضاري الماثل في شموخ وروعة.  ولا شك أن النهضة العمرانية التي أطلق الرمز الخالد المغفور له الوالد الشيخ زايد رحمه الله - وجدت في صاحب السمو رئيس الدولة الشيخ خليفة بن زايد حفظه الله - المتعهد الغيور، والراعي الصبور.  فقد أظهر سموه خلال تجربته القيادية الغنية بالبذل والعطاء، قدرة فائقة على التعامل مع الرؤى الاقتصادية الناجحة، والحزم في تجسيد الاستراتيجيات الكبرى التي ساهم في رسمها وتحديد أطرها واختيار وسائلها.  لقد وضع سموه رؤية اقتصادية متوازنة أمرعت إنجازات في كل المجالات، وقام حفظه الله بتأسيس وبناء العديد من القطاعات الاستراتيجية التي لا زالت عطاءاتها المثمرة تشهد على نفاذ بصيرته وعظيم حكمته ورجاحة رأيه.  فعلى مستوى قطاع النفط، ترأس سموه المجلس الأعلى للبترول منذ إنشائه عام ۱۹۸۸ ، فسخر هذه الثروة التي حبا الله تعالى بها البلد لتحقيق حياة كريمة لكل مواطن.  ومن منطلق الحرص على التوظيف الجيد لهذا المصدر المهم واستغلاله بعقلانية وكفاءة، بادر الشيخ خليفة إلى فتح مجال الصناعة البترولية وتطويرها بما يكفل المصالح الوطنية، ويدعم السيطرة على المقدرات النفطية للدولة، فوضع حفظه الله خططاً طموحة أثمرت قواعد ضخمة للصناعات البتروكيماوية  ولم يقتصر تفكير سموه على المورد الطبيعي في بناء الاقتصاد الوطني، بل أولى كبير الاهتمام وكثير الحرص لتنويع مصادر الدخل القومي فكان التوسع في مختلف النشاطات الإنتاجية والخدمية، مما أوجد ركائز وبدائل أعطت ديناميكية وتوازناً لبنية ونشاط الاقتصاد الوطني .  وقد قال سموه في هذا الإطار نجحنا في تنويع مصادر الدخل وبناء اقتصاد يعتمد على عوائد غير نفطية ) ... ( لقد اهتممنا بالتنمية الصناعية اهتماماً كبيراً على قاعدة تنويع الإنتاج والدخل القومي، فزادت المنشآت الصناعية التحويلية وانتشرت المصانع المتنوعة لكافة الاحتياجات الاستهلاكية والإنتاجية.  ولم يغفل سموه القطاع الزراعي، حيث احتل حيزاً هاماً في تفكيره ونال نصيباً وافراً من جهوده، مما جعل هذا القطاع الحيوي يقطع أشواطاً كبيرة في زمن قياسي، رغم حجم التحديات التي ليس أقلها قساوة الطبيعة .  وقد اعتمدت الاستراتيجية التنموية التي وضع صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد آل نهيان على مبدأ التوازن وتفعيل كل الامكانيات المتوافرة، كما أخذت على عاتقها مواكبة حركة التطور والتحول التي يعرفها الاقتصاد العالمي، مما سمح للاقتصاد الوطني بالانخراط في تيار العولمة من جهة والمحافظة على كيان الدولة وقوتها من جهة ثانية  وقد أكد سموه على ضرورة الانسجام الاقتصادي على الصعيدين الداخلي والخارجي من خلال «محورين رئيسيين أولهما المساهمة الفاعلة في قيام شراكة إستراتيجية حقيقية بين مؤسسات القطاع العام ومؤسسات القطاع الخاص، وثانيهما تكوين تحالفات إستراتيجية وقيام شركات مشتركة والعمل على تشجيع المؤسسات والشركات القائمة حالياً للاندماج وذلك بهدف خلق شركات عملاقة لإنتاج سلع وخدمات قادرة على المنافسة القوية في الأسواق المحلية والإقليمية والعالمية في ظل السياسات القائمة على أسس ومبادئ الحرية والمنافسة الدولية».  إن رؤية صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة للبناء والتنمية، على تنوع مجالاتها وغنى إنجازاتها وتعدد ميادينها ، جعلت من إنسان الإمارات هدفاً أسمى وغاية قصوى .. ولذا ما كان ليوازي حرص سموه على توفير وسائل العيش الكريم لأبناء هذا الوطن المعطاء إلا إصراره على تحميل المواطن مسؤولية الإسهام في صنع اليوم الزاهر والغد المشرق عبر تكوينه وإعداده وتعليمه ورعايته.  ولا شك أن مثل هذه الرؤية النيرة والمنهج المتوازن، يستحقان الاستجلاء والوقوف المتمعن على منطلقاتهما وغاياتهما ، ولذا نقدم للقارئ الكريم هذه الدراسة التي تلقي الضوء على جوانب يسيرة من مسيرة التنمية والبناء بقيادة صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد حفظه الله، آملين أن تفتح الباب لدراسات وكتب حول هذا الموضوع البحثي الثر.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=139892

138280	6	خليفة و التعاون الدولي : | صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد آل نهيان رئيس دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة /		كتاب "خليفة والتعاون الدولي" يتناول سيرة القائد صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد آل نهيان رئيس الدولة في ترسيخ علاقات الصداقة والتعاون مع مختلف دول العالم هذه المسيرة التي واكبت انطلاقة الإعمار الحضاري والتأسيس لعصر الشموخ الذي قاده الوالد الراحل صاحب السمو الشيخ زايد بن سلطان آل نهيان رحمه الله باني أمجاد ونهضة هذه الدولة التي أصبحت لها مكانة كبيرة بين الأمم، وبات يشار إليها بالبنان كنموذج يحتذى به في التطوير والازدهار. وقد واصل صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة حفظه الله ، وسعى حثيثاً لتطوير هذه العلاقات الدولية واستطاع بسياسته المتزنة وتفهمه الشامل لطبيعة تطورات القضايا المطروحة على الساحة العالمية أن يبرز إسهام دولة الإمارات في تحقيق أعلى مستوى ممكن من التعاون والتنسيق بين الدول المختلفة، وهذا ما يوضحه قول سموه في مجال التعاون الخارجي : ( إن دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة اختطت منذ أيامها الأولى سياسة خارجية معتدلة وحكيمة ساعدتها في أن تلعب دوراً مرموقاً على الصعيد الدولي ، واتسع نطاق علاقاتنا مع الكثير من الدول ، وامتد تعاوننا معها في جميع المجالات ، وبذلك أكدت دولة الإمارات أن قيام أية دولة بدور مهم وأساسي في الساحة الدولية ليس مرتبطاً باتساع رقعتها أو بضخامة مواردها أو عدد سكانها، ولكنه يرتبط بالمبادئ التي تؤمن بها وتدافع عنها وبالأهداف التي تسعى إلى تحقيقها على مستوى التعاون الدولي)) . ومن هذا المنطلق جاءت زيارات سموه إلى العديد من دول العالم للتباحث وتبادل الرأي مع زعماء وقادة هذه الدول حول العلاقات الثنائية والقضايا ذات الاهتمام المشترك وتعزيز القانون والأعراف الدولية بما يسهم في تحقيق السلام القائم على العدل والحق وتأكيد قرارات الشرعية الدولية التي هي الأساس وهي القاعدة لإيجاد الحلول العادلة لكل القضايا في المنطقة العربية والعالم. وكان طبيعياً أن تحتل العلاقات مع الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية جانباً هاماً من اهتمام الإمارات وجسدت الزيارة التي قام بها سمو الشيخ خليفة إلى واشنطن دليلاً على ما حققته هذه العلاقات من تقدم مثمر وثقة متبادلة. وقد حث سموه المسؤولين الأمريكيين أثناء اللقاءات التي عقدها معهم على ضرورة نشر السلام بين دول الشرق الأوسط ، لكي تنعم شعوب هذه المنطقة بالأمن والاستقرار وتتجه لتحقيق التنمية بأرقى ما تكون عليه طموحات وطن العصر وتطلعات مواطنيه . كما سعت الإمارات إلى تطوير علاقاتها مع دول الاتحاد الأوروبي ولاسيما مع فرنسا وبريطانيا وألمانيا وإسبانيا وإيطاليا وسويسرا، نظراً لأهمية هذه العلاقات وتشعبها في مختلف مجالات التعاون، وأولت الدولة اهتماماً كبيراً بعلاقاتها مع الدول الآسيوية الكبرى، وتجمعاتها الإقليمية النشطة بثقلها السياسي والاقتصادي. ولعل الزيارة التي قام بها سمو الشيخ خليفة لليابان كانت بداية عهد جديد للعلاقات بين الإمارات واليابان، بما أدت إليه من دفعة قوية لكافة سبل التعاون. وشهدت العلاقات مع الصين التي بدأت عام ۱۹۸٤ م ، تطوراً كبيراً عاد بالنفع على الدولتين. وإدراكاً لقيمة مردودات علاقات التعاون الدولي لدولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة التي حرص صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد آل نهيان على تنميتها وترقيتها، وبذل غاية الجهد لإعلاء شأنها، وإثراء نفعها، فإننا على يقين أن هذا الكتاب الذي يتناول زيارات سموه للولايات المتحدة الأمريكية والدولة الأوروبية وبعض الدول الصديقة، يشكل إضاءة لبعض ملامح هذا النهج السديد.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=138280
138279	6	تصريحات صاحب السمو الشيخ خليفة بن زايد آل نهيان التي أدلى بها لوسائل الإعلام منذ انعقاد قمة مجلس التعاون الأولى في أبو ظبي بتاريخ 25 مايو 1981 /		إن أبرز ما أكدته تجليات هذا العصر من تطورات وإنجازات متعاظمة، ليتجسد في إعلاء قيمة الوحدة والتكتل، سواء ما تعلق منها بالأطر والأنظمة السياسية، أو بالكيانات والتجمعات الاقتصادية والأمنية، حيث بات التكتل طريق المجابهة الأوحد لكل ما أفرزه ذلك العصر من تداعيات مؤكدة، ولكل ما أسفر عنه من إشكاليات معقدة.  ولم تكن حكمة قادة دول منطقة الخليج العربية بغافلة عن إدراك الأهمية القصوى لوحدتها المنشودة منذ أمد بعيد، فبالرغم من أن العلاقات الثنائية الوثيقة التي كانت تجمع بين الأشقاء ودولهم قد وفرت أساساً متيناً لصلات تعاون وشيجة في شتى المجالات عبر التاريخ الممتد، إلا أن أمل الوحدة ظل هدفاً لا يتزعزع؛ إدراكاً لما تؤديه هذه الوحدة من تعميق وتطوير للتعاون القائم، وتنسيق للسياسات والتوجهات في مختلف المجالات والميادين، صوناً وتعزيزاً للأمن، وسعياً للتقدم والرقي بما يكفله من رخاء ورفاهة للمواطنين، وعزة وقوة لدولهم المتحدة.  ومثل إيمان والدنا المغفور له صاحب السمو الشيخ زايد بن سلطان آل نهيان . رحمه الله وطيب ثراه - بحتمية وحدة الكلمة بين دول الخليج العربي، وحتمية تعاونها وتآزرها، دافعاً قوياً للسعي الجاد إلى تجسيد البناء الوحدوي الخليجي المتكامل فدائماً ما أعلن عن هذه الرغبة الملحة، ولم تفته مناسبة إلا وأكد على ضرورة صيرورتها حقيقة واقعة فكان - رحمه الله - يقول : إيماني قائم بأن يكون هذا الخليج كله موحدا ، فالوحدة أو الاتحاد قوة من غير شك ، ورغبتنا أن يكون الخليج وليس نحن فقط في صيغة وحدوية أو اتحادية لأجل أن يظل قوياً منيعا ، واتحادنا هنا ، هو من وحي هذا الأمل، حتى تكون هذه القوة قادرة أن تؤدي واجبها بين أشقائها في وقت نحتاج جميعاً إلى أداء هذا الواجب ضمن شعورنا بأن الوحدة هي إيمان، وهو إيمان موجود في قلب كل مخلص، في قلب كل مسؤول يعرف أن الوحدة قوة، وأن التفرق ضعف». فتحقق بالجهد المثابر ما تاقت إليه نفسه الخيرة، وأضحى الأمل واقعاً معاشاً تشهد بتفرده عظمة إنجازاته.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=138279

137142	6	إشكالية التاريخ الثقافي في مجتمع الإمارات /	مدن، حسن،	كتاب إشكالية التاريخ الثقافي في مجتمع الإمارات، الذي يضم أوراقاً بحثية من ندوة أقامتها دائرة الثقافة والإعلام في الشارقة، يناقش أهمية كتابة التاريخ الثقافي للإمارات كحقل مستقل نسبياً عن التاريخ العام. يبرز الكتاب التحديات التي تواجه توثيق الثقافة الشعبية والتراث الشفهي، مع الإشارة إلى الجهود الفردية والمؤسسية المبذولة، والتي رغم أهميتها تظل محدودة وتحتاج إلى استراتيجيات منهجية مدعومة رسمياً. يُعد الكتاب توطئة أولى لتحفيز المزيد من الدراسات حول هذا الموضوع الحيوي، مؤكداً أن التأني في دراسة هذه التفاصيل ضروري للحفاظ على ذاكرة المجتمع في مواجهة الإيقاع السريع للعصر الحديث.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=137142

134971	6	الضبط الإداري و سلطاته عبر العصور التاريخية وفي دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة : | النشأة و التطور /	القحطاني، محمد عبيد الحساوي،	تعد وظيفة الضبط الاداري ضرورة إجتماعية لازمة لاغنى عنها لإستقرار النظم ، وصيانة الحياة الاجتماعية للمجتمع والمحافظة عليها ، بل ومن أولويات واجبات الدولة وأهمها، وعصب السلطة وجوهرها ، فهي مقدمة على سائر وظائف الدولة الأخرى لقيامها على أكثر الأمور حيوية في المجتمع.   ووظيفة الضبط الاداري ، تهدف إلى حماية نظام الدولة وكيانها الإجتماعي ، والسياسي ، والإقتصادي ، ووقاية ذلك النظام من جميع الأخطار التي تهدده في أمنه وسكينته ، وصحته ، وآدابه ، وجمال الرونق والرواء فيه بما تفرضه وتقرره من أوامر وقرارات لذلك فإن على الفرد ، أن يلتزم في تصرفاته ، وأفعاله وأقواله الأصول ، والقواعد ، التي لها حدود لا يجوز تخطيها من إحترام للدستور والقانون ولإزدياد أهمية وظيفة الضبط الإداري ، بإزدياد تدخل الدولة في جميع نواحي الحياة ، وتزايد مسؤولياتها واتساع نشاطها ، وتضاعف صور تدخلها في أوجه النشاط الفردي ، بحكم مذاهب التدخل والرقابة.  فقد ثبت أن هذا النشاط الفردي ، لم يكن كفيلا بذاته ولا كافيا وحده لتحقيق المصالح الجماعية ، بل أن تلك المصالح ترتبط بحقوق الأفراد وحرياتهم العامة ، ولابد من ضرورة التدخل لتنظيم هذه الحقوق والحريات وتحديد وسائل وأهداف ممارستها ، للوقاية من شرورها وتحقيق الخير العام عن طريقها  ولذلك وضعت القواعد القانونية المنظمة لها محليا ودوليا ليتاح للأفراد التمتع بها ، فهي حقوق لصيقة بهم ولدت معهم ولا يمكن للدولة النيل منها ، كونها كسبا طبيعيا وحقيقيا لأي إنسان ، لمجرد إنسانيته نشاة معه وهي سابقة على نشاة الدولة  وديننا الإسلامي كان ومازال سباقا لذلك حيث قرر للأفراد حقوقهم وحرياتهم وأوجد لها كافة الضمانات لحمايتها ، من أي اعتداء وأقام لها صرحا شاملا ومتكاملا فلا يوجد تعارض بينها وبين التنظيم ، الذي يعطي المناخ المناسب والملائم للمارستها ، لأنه إذا ترك للأفراد الشأن في ممارسة حرياتهم بالطرق التي تروق لهم ، فمن المؤكد أن يحدث نوع من التضارب والتعارض ، اللذان تنتفي معهما فكرة الحرية وتعم الفوضى المجتمعات، حيث لا ضمان لسلامة وأمن الوطن.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=134971
134970	6	الضبط الإداري : | سلطاته و حدوده في دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة: دراسة مقارنة مع مصر /	القحطاني، محمد عبيد الحساوي،	تعتبر وظيفة الضبط الإداري ضرورة لازمة للاستقرار وصيانة نظم الحياة الاجتماعية والمحافظة عليها فبدونها تعم الفوضى وينهار النظام الاجتماعي فهي كانت ومازالت من أولى واجبات الدولة وأهمها وعصب السلطة العامة وجوهرها ، ومن هنا يأتي ارتباطها الوثيق بالحرية التي تعتبر الركن الأساسي لأي نظام اجتماعي يقوم على الديمقراطية ، فكليهما يرتبطان ارتباطا وثيقا ولا وجود لأحدهما دون الآخر.  وللأسباب داتها عكف المشرعون في كل أرجاء المعمورة على وضع القواعد القانونية المنظمة ، ليتاح للأفراد التمتع بها فهي حقوق لصيقة بهم ولدت معهم ، ولا يمكن للدولة النيل منها لأنها تعد كسبا طبيعيا وحقيقيا لأي إنسان لمجرد انسانيته نشأت معه ، وهي سابقة على نشأة الدولة  ولا يكاد يخلو دستور من الدساتير ، ولا المواثي - اقليمية كانت أو عالمية -من الاعتراف للأفراد بكل أنواع الحريات وبتنظيم ممارستهم لها وبشكل أكبر الحريات الشخصية ومن هذا المنطلق فإن على الدولة احترامها وحمايتها وعدم مد سلطته إليها إلا بالقدر الذي تتطلبه ضرورة حماية الآخرين وحرياتهم .  وديننا الإسلامي كان سباقا لدلك ، حيث قرر للأفراد حقوقهم وحرياتهم وأوجد لها كافة الضمانات لحمايتها من أي اعتداء ، وأقام لها صرحا متكاملا وشاملا ومع تطور مفهوم التزام الدول بحماية الحريات الشخصية فإنه يقع عليها واجب التدخل لتوفيرها على اعتبار أنها أسمى الحقوق التي يكفلها الدستور ، ويقرها القانون ، واستقر عليها فقهيا فلا يوجد تعارض بينها وبين التنظيم الدي يعطي المناخ المناسب والملائم لممارستها ، لأنه إذا ترك للأفراد الشأن في ممارسة حرياتهم بالطرق التي تروق لهم ، فإنه من المؤكد أن يحدث نوع من التضارب والتعارض ، وتعم الفوضى المجتمعات حيث لاضمان السلامة وأمن المواطن ومن هنا تبرز فكرة الضبط الإداري لخلق نوع من التوازن بين ممارسة الحرية الشخصية ، وصيانة النظام العام ، فالضبط الإداري عملية مستمرة ومتتطورة لا تتوقف عند مرحلة معينة، بل أنه دائم كلما دعت الحاجة لذلك وفقا للظروف والعوامل المؤثرة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=134970

133766	3	العولمة و التفكك/	كلارك،ايان،	إن ما يعرضه هذا الكتاب ليس سرداً تاريخياً آخر لأهم أحداث القرن العشرين، كالحربين العالميتين والحرب الباردة، بل هو يقدم قراءة تفسيرية وتحليلية لمجريات القرن العشرين المتناقضة عبر جدلية العولمة والتفكك؛ إذ يسعى إلى استقصاء التوجهات نحو العولمة وما يقابلها من نزعات الانفصال والتفكك في القرن العشرين، والتي هي عمليات لا تحدث على مستوى النظام الدولي فحسب، بل أيضاً على مستوى الإقليم والدولة نفسها.    وقبل أن يمضي الباحث في تحليله التاريخي قدماً، قام بتعريف العولمة والتفكك؛ إذ يرى أن "العولمة" لفظة يقصد بها التوجهات المتمثلة سواء في قوة التفاعلات الدولية أو في المدى الذي تحدث فيه هذه التفاعلات، لذا فهي بالمعنى الأول تتماثل مع أفكار مثل التكامل والتعددية والانفتاح، بينما تشير في المعنى الثاني إلى الانتشار الجغرافي لهذه الاتجاهات، وهي بذلك قريبة من مفاهيم العالمية والكونية والتجانس واختصار المسافات المكانية. أما "التفكك" فهي لفظة تعني عكس تلك الاتجاهات، غير أن لها البعدين كليهما: فهي توحي بالتفتت والاكتفاء الذاتي والأحادية والانغلاق والانعزال، كما تعني من ناحية أخرى التوجه نحو القومية أو الإقليمية والانفصالية والتمايز وتضخيم المسافات المكانية.    وقد بنى الباحث تحليله التاريخي على تصنيف القرن العشرين إلى مراحل وفترات تاريخية متباينة (مثل فترة ما بين الحربين العالميتين 1919-1939، وفترة ما بعد الحرب الباردة 1990-2000)، لمعرفة قوى العولمة والتفكك في كل فترة، باعتبارها أن هاتين القوتين هما مفتاحا فهم الخصائص المميزة للقرن العشرين.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=133766

132440	6	دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة : | مسيرة الإتحاد و مستقبله /	بشير، اسكندر،	نشوء الدول وتطورها يُعدّان من الأحداث التاريخية المهمة التي ينبغي أن تستأثر بالاهتمام والدراسة بحد ذاتها ولاعتبارات جمة . ودراسة الأنظمة الحديثة النشأة تخضع للموضوعية أكثر من غيرها ، كما هي الحال في هذه الدراسة التي تتناول دولة الإمارات العربية المتحدة من حيث تجربتها ومستقبل الاتحاد فيها .  هذه الدولة الفتية قد أسست في ٢ ديسمبر ( كانون الأول ) ۱۹۷۱ ، وهي تتمتع بكيان سياسي مميز عن غيرها في العالم العربي لكونه نظاماً اتحادياً وإنما ذا انتماء عربي وشخصية إسلامية  لا شك أن النظام الاتحادي هو في بداية الطريق ولا تزال تعترضه صعوبات جمة تعود بمعظهما إلى طبيعة مقتضيات العمل بنظام دستوري متطور في مجتمع تغلبت فيه الحياة القبلية وتقاليدها عبر أجيال من الزمن . فكانت الصيغة الاتحادية وليدة معادلة دقيقة تجمع في مضامينها بين الكيانية الذاتية المحلية المتعددة الأنساب وبين الرغبة لدى أبناء الشعب ذوي التراث الواحد والمصلحة المشتركة في ضرورة الانصهار في بوتقة سياسية موحدة.  ولما كانت الصيغة الاتحادية تطرح نفسها بين الحين والآخر كنموذج يمكن الاحتذاء به في العالم العربي بصفة مرحلية ، تعبيراً عن أماني الأمة في الوحدة الكاملة أو نتيجةً لنظرة قد تكون أكثر واقعية بالنسبة لإمكانات تحقيق التعاون السياسي في هذه المرحلة من حياة العالم العربي ، فإن التجربة الاتحادية لغنية بالدروس والعبر التي يمكن الاستفادة منها ، علماً بأن هذه التجربة هي في أولى مراحلها وقد تتبعها إجراءات مستقبلية في بعض المجالات أكثر اندماجية ووحدوية  وعلى صعيد آخر ، تتمتع دولة الإمارات العربية بمكانة اقتصادية مهمة عائدة إلى انتاجها النفطي الذي يبلغ حوالي %١٦ من إنتاج منظمة الأقطار العربية المصدرة للنفط ( الاوابيك ) وهو يوازي ٣٪ من إنتاج المنظمة العاليمة المصدرة للنفط ( الأوبيك ) وقد تفاوت إنتاج الدولة للنفط في السنين الأخيرة وفقاً لسياسات اتبعت لتخفيض الإنتاج. ويلاحظ أن أقصى معدل للإنتاج اليومي تجاوز بقليل المليوني برميل في اليوم ، لعام ۱۹۷۷ . أما معدل الإنتاج عام ١٩٨٠ فقد بلغ مليوناً وثماني مئة وثلاثين ألف ( ۱,۸۳۰,۰۰۰ ) برميل يومياً موزعة بنسب متفاوتة بين ثلاث من إمارات الاتحاد المنتجة للنفط ففي إمارة أبو ظبي ، وهي الأكثر إنتاجاً ، وصل المعدل اليومي إلى مليون وأربع مئة واثنين وستين ألف ( ١,٤٦٢,٠٠٠ ) برميل في اليوم . وتليها إمارة دبي التي وصل معدل إنتاجها إلى ثلاث مئة وأربع وخمسين ألف ( ٣٥٤,٠٠٠) برميل في اليوم . وفي إمارة الشارقة بلغ معدل الإنتاج أربعة عشر ألف ( ١٤,٠٠٠ ) برميل في اليوم . علماً بأن آباراً جديدة اكتشفت حديثاً ) أي سنة ۱۹۸۱ ) في المياه الإقليمية لإمارة الشارقة لم تحدد كمياتها أو تاريخ المباشرة في إنتاجها بعد أما ما اكتشف من النفط في المياه الإقليمية لإمارة رأس الخيمة عام ۱۹۷۷ فلم تتضح بعد إمكانات استخراجه بكميات تجارية مربحة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=132440

129912	3	الحركات الاسلامية واثرها في الاستقرار السياسي في العالم العربي /		سجلت الحركات الإسلامية – وما تزال- حضوراً قوياً في الحياة السياسية والاجتماعية في العالم العربي خلال المئة عام الماضية، بسبب أهدافها والأساليب التي سلكتها في الوصول إلى تلك الأهداف، والتي تمثلت أساساً في أسلمة الدولة أو المجتمع الذي تعيش فيه، مما أدى إلى صدام واشتباك مع بعض الأنظمة السياسية العربية ولفترات زمنية طويلة، الأمر الذي أثّر بصورة كبيرة في الاستقرار السياسي والاجتماعي في هذه الدول.    يتضمن هذا الكتاب عدداً من الدراسات التي تعرض وجهات نظر وقراءات واجتهادات مهمة لعدد من الباحثين المتخصصين في موضوع الحركات الإسلامية، وبخاصة الظروف والملابسات التي أدت إلى ظهور هذه الحركات، والعلاقة بين فكر هذه الحركات والممارسة العملية لهذا الفكر في الواقع السياسي والاجتماعي، وجنوح هذه الحركات إلى التطرف أو الاعتدال في تحقيق أهدافها، وأسباب ذلك ودوافعه وانعكاسه على الواقع العربي. ونتيجة لذلك وسمت هذه الحركات بأنها تقف موقفاً رافضاً وعدائياً من الديمقراطية والتعددية السياسية، مما برر استبعادها من المشاركة السياسية، فأدى ذلك إلى زيادة التوتر وعدم الاستقرار، ومن أجل تجنب حالة الصدام هذه كان لا بد من فتح المجال أمامها للمشاركة السياسية باعتبارها إحدى القوى السياسية الفاعلة، وهذا يؤدي بالضرورة إلى التساؤل حول مستقبل هذه الحركات في ظل هذا الوضع وفي ظل المتغيرات الإقليمية والدولية ولا سيما بعد اتهام بعضها بالتطرف والإرهاب، وإعلان الحرب على بعضها سواء من الناحية العسكرية أو القانونية، والمتمثل في تغيير التشريعات القانونية فيما يتعلق بتمويلها أو دعمها أو حتى شرعية وجودها وبخاصة في الدول الغربية.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=129912

129909	3	المنظور الاسلامي للتنمية البشرية /	العاني ، اسامة عبد المجيد	تأتي هذه الدراسة في محاولة لوضع لبنة في بناء السياق العلمي للنظام الاقتصادي الإسلامي. وقد اشتمل هذا البحث على أربعة محاور تناول أولها مفهوم التنمية البشرية من وجهة النظر الاقتصادية، في حين تناول الثاني الإسلام والتنمية البشرية، وبحث الثالث في النظام المالي للإسلام ودوره في تمويل التنمية البشرية. وتم أخيراً في المحور الرابع التطرق إلى بعض التطبيقات النبوية التي تتواءم والتنمية البشرية.    وتهدف للوصول إلى استنتاج مفاده بأن الرجوع إلى الإسلام بمصادره التشريعية كافة كفيل بتحقيق النهوض وإزالة الجمود ووضع البديل لإخفاقات النظريات الاقتصادية الحديثة، وشق الطريق الصحيح بتنمية المجتمع وأفراده على حد سواء، وأداء الدور الذي أراده الله لنا في هذه الحياة.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=129909

124572	6	الإمارات العربية و الخط الجوي البريطاني إلى الشرق 1929 - 1952 /	الصايغ، فاطمة،	يبحث هذا الكتاب في فترة تاريخية مهمة من فترات العلاقات الإماراتية - البريطانية هي  فترة ما بين الحربين العالميتين. ففي هذه الفترة ضعف وضع الإمارات الاقتصادي بشكل كبير نتيجة لانهيار أسواق اللؤلؤ في الوقت الذي بدأت فيه بشائر مصادر اقتصادية أخرى ممثلة في الامتيازات الجوية وهو المصدر الذي كان الإنجليز يمسكون بزمامه. فبعد الحرب العالمية الأولى أدركت بريطانيا أهمية الطيران في تعزيز نفوذها في مستعمراتها، لذلك بدأت في إنشاء شبكة خطوط جوية تربط مستعمراتها في المشرق ببعضها البعض. وقد ظهرت أهمية منطقة الإمارات كحلقة وصل بين الشرق والغرب، لذا أصبح تواجد القواعد الجوية المدنية والعسكرية فيها أمراً حيوياً لخدمة المصالح البريطانية، وتطلب إنشاء القواعد الجوية على طول سواحل الإمارات ليس فقط مجهوداً جباراً ولكن تغييراً فعلياً في الإدارة البريطانية تجاه الإمارات، مما استلزم من بريطانيا أن تضع جانباً سياستها التقليدية القائمة على مبدأ عدم التدخل، وإلى تبني سياسة التدخل السافر في الشؤون الداخلية للإمارات.  خدمت هذه القواعد الجوية المصالح البريطانية في الحرب والسلم. ولكن بعد انتهاء الحرب العالمية الثانية بدأت هذه القواعد بالتدريج تفقد أهميتها نظراً للتطور التكنولوجي الهائل الذي شهده عالم الطيران مما دعا بريطانيا إلى إلغاء معظم هذه القواعد وإلى مراجعة أخرى لسياستها تجاه الإمارات. وما بين إنشاء وإلغاء هذه القواعد الجوية شهدت العلاقات الإماراتية - البريطانية تغييرات جذرية أثرت على الوضع الداخلي والإقليمي.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=124572
124571	6	الطب في الإمارات العربية المتحدة : | النشأة والتطور /	غباش ، رفيعة عبيد	تتحدث الدكتورة رفيعة عبيد غباش والدكتورة مريم سلطان لوتاه في هذا الكتاب عن تاريخ الطب في الإمارات العربية المتحدة، وذلك من خلال دراسة تناولت تطور سيرة الخدمات الصحية منذ عام 1900 الذي تعرضت من خلاله وبالتحديد الدكتورة مريم في الفصل الأول من هذا الكتاب للطب العربي. بالإضافة إلى ذلك فقد أفردت فصلا متعلقا بالوثائق البريطانية نظرا لارتباط المادة الوثائقية التي استيقت منها مادة هذا الفصل ببعض الأحداث السياسية على مستوى المنطقة الأمر الذي تطلب رؤية وتحليلا تاريخيا خاصا بهذه الأحداث. والذي حمل على التدوين لتاريخ الطب في الإمارات منذ عام 1900 بالنسبة للدكتورة رفيعة عبيد غباش هو كون ذلك التاريخ يعكس الدلالات السياسية والدينية وموقف الناس من الحملات التبشيرية، وصلابة وقوة قناعاتهم الفكرية والعقائدية التي حالت دون تأثرهم بتلك الحملات وإن كانت مصدر علاج بالإضافة إلى كون هذا التأريخ لم يدون.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=124571

124405	6	زايد و الأمل العربي /		إنها مناسبة مباركة بإذن الله أن تحتضن دولة الإمارات ندوة "مستقبل الوطن العربي" بدعوة كريمة من صاحب السمو الوالد الشيخ زايد بن سلطان آل نهيان رئيس الدولة، لمناقشة التحديات التي تتعرض لها الأمة العربية وبحث السبل الكفيلة بمواجهتها، في وقت تعاظمت فيه التحديات والأخطار، وأصبح السعي لتوحيد الصف وتنقية الأجواء وإزالة الخلافات أمراً ملحاً ونحن نستعد لولوج القرن الحادي والعشرين مدركين أنه لا مكان في عالم اليوم للأمم المتناحرة المتخاصمة وأن التضامن العربي هو العلاج الفعال لمختلف الأمراض المستعصية التي تنخر في الجسد العربي فتشل قواه وتضعف قدرته على الحركة. من هنا يأتي دور النخبة من القادة والمفكرين السياسيين للنهوض بهذه المرحلة والعمل على تخطي الصعاب ورسم طريق المستقبل لأجيالنا على امتداد الوطن العربي الكبير بما يضمن لها الزهو والفخار بالانتماء لهذه الأمة، وعلى الرغم من أن الطريق ليست مفروشة بالورود لكن الإيمان بأن المقومات التي تجمع وتوحد هذه الأمة أكبر بكثير مما يفرقها هو نبراسنا نحو المزيد من العمل البناء، لأن ما يوحد أمتنا ضارب في وجدان العربي وممزوج بدمه وبالهواء الذي يستنشقه ومعجون بذرات الأمل والألم التي تبين ملامحه على امتداد الوطن من الخليج إلى المحيط، ولنا في صاحب السمو رئيس الدولة القدوة الحسنة، فقد آمن سموه بالوحدة وبالتآزر والتعاضد بين الأشقاء وحمل منذ أن تسلم مقاليد السلطة لواء الوحدة قولاً وفعلاً، فعمل سموه على بناء اتحاد الإمارات السبع في دولة واحدة أصبحت نموذجاً يحتذا بين الأشقاء، مؤكداً لكل المشككين واليائسين أن التجربة الوحدوية ليست صعبة المنال إذا صدقت النوايا وصحت العزائم.   وكانت دولة الاتحاد منطلقاً لسموه نحو صيغة جديدة للتنسيق العربي وصولاً إلى التكامل المنشود من خلال جهوده وإخوانه قادة دول المنطقة لإقامة مجلس التعاون لدول الخليج العربية التي كانت لأبوظبي شرف احتضان قمتها الأولى، ولكن تبقى هموم البيت العربي الكبير الشغل الشاغل لسموه والمتتبع لأقوال وأحاديث صاحب السمو رئيس الدولة يدرك أن الدعوة إلى التضامن العربي وتوحيد الصف وتنقية الأجواء شغلت الحيز الأكبر من اهتماماته على مدى السنوات الماضية.  ويحاول هذا الكتاب تقديم عرض لأقوال وأحاديث سموه التي تناولت هموم الأمة العربية ومشكلاتها، آملين أن يسهم في إلقاء الضوء على المواقف الثابتة لصاحب السمو رئيس الدولة إزاء القضايا المصيرية التي تواجه أمتنا العربية.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=124405

121385	3	United Arab Emirates society in the twenty-first century: | issues and challenges in a changing world /	Al-Suwaidi, Jamal S. ,	"In the light of the radical transformations and changes that the world has witnessed on all levels, research in the field of social issues is gaining increased prominence, praticularly amid different sources of danger that threaten social security in countries, due to changes in the nature of warfare and conflicts, the spread of extremism and terrorism, and the emergence of religious, sectarian, doctrinal, and racial tensions. Moreover, the unprecedented technological transformations in light of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) with its social effects can compromise the stability and security of societies. Thefore, in this book I focus on studying UAE society in an ever-changing world from a comprehensive perspective that encompasses political, security, economic, social, cultural, and technological aspects. From an early stage in my academic career, I have given special attention - in my books, research papers, and studies - to issues of national security, at the forefront of which is social security. This stems from my belief that social security is one of the most important and critical aspects of national security in its comprehensive sense. Futhermore, social security is also closely associated with all other political, economic, cultural, and stability aspects of national security"--							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=121385

It has seen the rise and fall of a thriving pearl industry, piracy, invasions and wars, and the arrival of the oil age that would make it one of the richest countries on earth. Since the early 1970s, when seven sheikhs agreed to enter into a union, it has been a sovereign nation, carrying on the resourceful spirit#x14;with resplendent fervor#x14;that the brutally inhospitable landscape has long demanded of the people. Ultimately, Morton shows that the country is not only rich in oil and money but in an extraordinarily deep history and culture." --							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=120985

Shaikh Zayid Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the leader and the nation /		A detailed account of the personal charisma of the man and a deep commitment he had toward improvement of the quality of life of his people. The story of his quest that culminated in the establishment of the UAE Federation. Documentation of his unique capacities of leadership, intuitive political skill and resolute determination. New section as a retrospective on his achievements and the lasting legacy of his rule  Visionary statesmen who have created an enduring state edifice through purposeful consensus and persuasion remain a historical rarity. The formation of the United Arab Emirates on December 2, 1971 under the inspiring leadership of its founding father, H.H. Shaikh Zayid Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, is a unique example of the building of a prosperous nation that has earned its founder his rightful place among the outstanding statesmen of all time.   Against the backdrop of the British withdrawal from the Arabian Gulf region, it was H.H. Shaikh Zayid who accomplished the complex task of unifying the erstwhile Trucial States, creating the only thriving federal state in the Middle East. While fulfilling his personal destiny as the chosen leader, H.H. Shaikh Zayid strengthened the nation by uniting disparate tribal groups and sustained it against formidable challenges. He pioneered the modernization of the country and ultimately realized his dream of an effective framework for collaboration with neighboring Gulf states. The UAE has since become a constructive force within the region and beyond, exemplifying the principles of national unity, regional solidarity, international cooperation and religious tolerance.   This book adopts a scholarly approach in analyzing the UAE{u2019}s unique federal experience, its phenomenal achievements and H.H. Shaikh Zayid{u2019}s far-sighted policies. It is an in-depth study of the birth of a progressive nation and the pivotal role of its leader, based largely on unpublished historical records and documents. The factual foundation of the book and its meticulous documentation make it a valuable record covering an important era in the contemporary history of the Arab Gulf region.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=118703

118642	3	A history of Hezbollah activities in the Arabian Gulf region /	Levitt, Matthew,	This study provides the reader with an insight into the extent to which Hezbollah has circumvented regional and international efforts geared towards combating the organization’s clandestine activities. Ever since Hezbollah’s formation in the early-1980s and right up until the present day, the organization’s activities have yielded significant strategic gains across the Arabian Gulf region. Research findings presented within this paper demonstrate how Hezbollah clearly demands respect among military strategists, policy and decision makers alike, repeatedly revealing itself as an exemplary Iranian proxy capable of carrying out Iran’s bidding whilst avoiding obvious traces of Iranian interference. As highlighted throughout this research paper, Hezbollah has learnt valuable strategic lessons from a number of confrontations it has entered into with its adversaries. For example, the group is seemingly aware of the strategic benefits available to it should it decide to prey upon Western nation-states’ reluctance to incur substantial losses to their respective armed forces. Other examples include the understanding that the kidnapping of political and military opponents has potential to secure the successful exchange of detainees.    Following on from the initial US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Hezbollah’s stock has clearly continued to soar during the course of the Iraq War. Hezbollah’s battle-hardened approach to countering better equipped and better manned armed forces is widely understood. Less talked about perhaps, but clearly equally important as argued in this study, are other skills which Iran has come to rely on, such as the group’s linguistic skills and consequent ability to transfer its military expertise to other insurgent groups keen to mimic Hezbollah’s internal proficiency. Hezbollah’s direct involvement in the ongoing Syrian civil war partly explains how the regime of Bashar Al-Assad has stemmed the tide of resistance and begun to gain the upper hand. In summary, as events in Syria illustrate, Hezbollah continues to exert a considerable influence over regional developments, and consequently the regional balance of power.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=118642

It has coped with the demands of an exploding population, and consistently morphed, adapting to the new realities of a developing legal framework, and the demands of the 21st century.

Analysing a wealth of new evidence, he suggests that Shaikh Salman should now be considered one of the pioneers of the modern Middle East. He rejects the accepted historiography, based on a partial reading of the evidence, that credits others with the creation of Bahrain's structure of social welfare.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=118473

118431	3	Geopolitics of deception : | media, framing, and war by other means /	Sabet, Amr G. E.,	This paper focuses on media and communicative framing within the context of strategy and strategic interaction as articulated by some major thinkers in both fields. It will examine how informational virtual space, through a medium of strategic deception, constructs contextual frames or what may be called master frames, with the purpose of re-positioning an audience, through a process of conversion, in ways that elicit dynamics of fragmentary and oppositional social movements in the service of hegemonic geopolitical and security interests. In the process it will also attempt to shed light on the meaning and consequences of framing as a substantive form of political communication embedded in the indirect approach of war articulated by British strategist Basil Liddell Hart.  Beyond simply being an instrument of propagation and propaganda, media has increasingly evolved into a power and security form of social and political organization. It has become a matter of high politics as it frames and re-frames perceptions, ideas as well as psychological and mental structures along lines that touch upon the very heart of a society{u2019}s or a country{u2019}s national security structure. To the extent that media and war increasingly come to share symbiotic forms of strategic interaction, a symbiosis of soft power and hard power respectively, what evolves is a dynamic of framing {u2014} a scheme of comprehension that shapes the physical as well as mental and psychological boundaries and limitations of a group, audience or collectivity with or without them necessarily being aware of its structural impact.  This condition renders media a political weapon of war in its own right equal in scope and dimension to those of the actual physical or military.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=118431

After the first decade of the 21st century, in which the United States was, for good or ill, a transformative force in Middle Eastern politics, Obama has set a much more cautious and pragmatic course for the second decade. His administration will continue to pressure Iran diplomatically and economically, but key cabinet officers have cast doubt on the utility of striking that country. Washington has signaled that it wants to avoid a military entanglement in Syria. In the first Obama administration, it announced a policy of pivoting toward Asia, and put many of its diplomatic efforts into Pacific Rim relationships. Even if this policy is moderated in the second term, Asia will certainly bulk large."--Introduction.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=118427
117735	3	Labor Mobility : | an enabler for sustainable dvelopment /		Labor mobility is particularly significant in the case of the GCC; the region is host to around 15 million expatriate workers who generate US $80 billion in annual remittances each year and support an estimated 150 million dependents in their various home countries. However, little research has been conducted to identify and measure the impacts of this phenomenon on migrants{u2019} host countries or countries of origin. Therefore, with a view to contributing to the active engagement of GCC countries in the global dialogue on migration and development, the Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research (ECSSR) hosted a special conference, Labor Mobility: Enabler for Sustainable Development, in Abu Dhabi on May 14{u2013}15, 2013.  The Conference was held under the patronage of H.H. Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Presidential Affairs, and was jointly organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Labor, the ECSSR and the National Qualification Authority. It was convened in association with the GCC Council of Ministers of Labor, the Government of Sweden {u2013} current Chair of the Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD) {u2013} the International Organization for Migration and the World Bank.  The papers presented at the Conference, compiled in this volume, provide a variety of informed views on labor mobility as an enabler for human, economic and social development. They explore migration policy and governance in the GCC states; the potential for research collaboration between migrant-sending and -receiving countries; the impact of Indian labor migration to the GCC states; the relationship between remittances and economic cycles in home and host countries; and the implications of labor mobility for families and households.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=117735
117733	3	Information technology and the future of education in the United Arab Emirates /		The UAE has taken concerted steps in order to ensure economic diversification of its key sectors as a means to ensure it is not entirely dependent on an oil/petroleum-based economy. Underpinning this diversification has been the commitment to the creation of a competitive knowledge-based economy, which, unlike agricultural and industrial economies, is not one that relies on natural/physical resources, but instead on a greater reliance on intellectual capabilities. All these requirements are dependent upon an effective education system. Various countries around the world have had great success at matching their education system to the demands of industry and society as well as incorporating the latest technology to improve education.  However, exploiting the digital revolution does not stop at secondary education, and the tertiary level of learning can benefit enormously from such digital developments. As technology develops there are new ways to undertake learning and research and more flexible delivery of learning or faster and more sophisticated academic processes. The ubiquitous nature of the internet means that the use of this technology is part and parcel of our everyday life both in our personal and working life; therefore, it is an inevitability in education. Digital infrastructure can be defined as including technical services, technical standards, software tools, supporting policies, practice and regulatory frameworks. It allows for the appropriate creation, management and exploitation of information, resources and services to enable effective and high quality research and education. While more and more people involved in the educational process accept the notion that ICT has become part of our everyday life, and recognize the value of ICT as an enhancer for teaching and learning, there is an increasing demand for educators to have expertise in both their specific subject areas and competence in ICT. The essence of digital information and services, such as the worldwide web, means a whole new mode of operation and production of information, learning and research. It means there are new possibilities and a lot still yet to be imagined. Digital information can be replicated perfectly many times; add a network to that and it can be shared and accessed the world over; add the web to that and it can be viewed, annotated and linked to by anyone anywhere.  Information technology not only facilitates how information is imparted in the learning environment, but also alters the relationships between participants in schools, colleges and universities, whether they by teachers, technicians or parents. Not only can more exciting and innovative forms of learning be created, but also the inclusion of all stakeholders in the learning process can be encouraged, which leads to greater understanding, encouragement of other ideas to stimulate learning, and ultimately a more rounded and educated individual and society.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=117733
117730	3	From Tribe to Facebook : | The transformational role of social networks /	Al-Suwaidi, Jamal S.    ,	The recent proliferation of social networks has led to a societal shift {u2013} from a tribal mentality to that of Facebook {u2013} and has served to connect people from around the world with common cultural, religious, political and economic characteristics in an unprecedented manner and with astonishing speed. When such vast numbers of individuals congregate via social networks, societies that were once imaginary become real {u2014} the virtual worlds they inhabit expand and instill in their {u2018}citizens{u2019} a shared desire to establish and enforce their common interests.  This study charts the impact of this phenomenon in order to explore and analyze the potential outcomes of the accelerated development of social networks. Their economic potential in general is discussed, as are their implications for the future of traditional media forms, both as sources of news and key platforms for shaping public opinion.  It also explores the use of social networks by terrorists and organized criminal gangs {u2013} a trend which has not only led to the development of new forms of criminal activity, but also to the {u2018}globalization{u2019} of crime {u2013} and examines the potential for new forms of {u2018}virtual{u2019} conflict to arise, with the Internet as the battlefield, social networks as the weapons, and states and citizens as the combatants.  In the area of domestic security, the study proposes that defense and intelligence agencies will depend on social networks to wage, and defend against various forms of information warfare, as well as to monitor the movements and communications of individuals under surveillance.  A major focus of the study is the growing ability of protestors and advocates of political change in countries with repressive regimes to create significant {u2018}virtual{u2019} political pressure through social networks, obtaining and disseminating information without censorship in a new {u2018}information democracy.{u2019} It is this role of social networks in the political and social make-up of nations that defines the importance of this study; particularly in view of the fact that social networks have recently become a vital variable in socio-economic mobility across the globe, and in the Arab world in particular.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=117730

117671	3	The Future of Warfare in the 21st Century /		Concepts and theories of war-fighting have evolved radically over the past twenty years, resulting in equally radical changes in military doctrine. Emergent non-conventional security threats have led to a proliferation of asymmetric conflicts, while new modes of virtual warfare have developed in the realms of cyberspace.   The ECSSR 18th Annual Conference, The Future of Warfare in the 21st Century, held at the Center on April 9{u2013}10, 2013 in Abu Dhabi, and the resultant papers contained in this volume, explore how warfare may be affected by technological, strategic and civil developments in the coming years, particularly the revolutionary use of remote and autonomous systems on the modern battlefield, the budding application of cyber attack and defense strategies, and the future direction of intelligence operations in the 21st century. The authors also discuss political and civil influences on the future of warfare, particularly in terms of the evolving state of civil{u2013}military relations; the growing employment of contractors in contemporary conflicts; and the complex evolving relationship between defense industries and military establishments.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=117671

116130	6	Abu Dhabi's vision 2030 : | an ongoing journey of economic development /	Low, Linda,	This book aims to tell the Abu Dhabi story in economic development, from its past dominance in oil to its economic vision for the future. More than being an exemplar of industrial restructuring and diversification from a resource-based to a 21st century knowledge-based economy and society, Abu Dhabi emphasises its cultural legacy and tradition as an environmental advocate for green and sustainable pathways. It has as many challenges as creative responses to show that its success is not by wealth alone. This case study unveils Abu Dhabi in particular and the rest of Arabic and GCC economic development in general. They have all attracted foreign investment and global business, typically as hydrocarbon-rich resource economies. Beyond that, the geoeconomics and geopolitics of the Middle East and North Africa, with or without the Arab Spring in 2011 is in and of itself, a rich region for multidisciplinary studies and research, not just for economics and business. With Qatar, Abu Dhabi boasts of one of the highest per capita income in the world; therein lies a reason to enquire about its success and pivotal role in the GCC and global contexts.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=116130
114942	3	Formulating an Arab Approach to Maritime Security/	Al-Wahishi, Ahmed Salem,	Yemen and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are facing threats to their maritime security in light of piratical activity in the region of the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. Piracy threats are extending into new regions as demonstrated by challenges in Guinea Bay on the west coast of Africa. As terrorist and piracy acts have escalated in the Gulf of Aden and Arabian sea since the beginning of this century, Yemen has made efforts to defend its territorial waters by establishing a coastguard capability. In this respect we express our gratitude to the UAE as the first country to support us by providing our coastguard service with a number of vessels, and enable us to fulfill our duties toward maritime security. The waterways and ports such as Bab el-Mandab and the port of Aden are areas of continuing economic, strategic and grand strategic interest to the international community; they are all of parallel geostrategic importance. Therefore, there are compelling reasons for concrete actions to step up security in the strategic waterways and ports at a time when terrorists are looking for soft targets. The fact is that the security of the Red Sea, Bab el-Mandab Straits, Gulf of Aden, and Arabian Sea, are among the world{u2019}s busiest waterways. Yemen{u2019}s cooperation with the international community is part of an ambitious effort to improve security worldwide and this cooperation will develop further. Given the strong and multilateral interest of the international community in the Red Sea, Bab el-Mandeb Straits, the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea, the littoral states must do their best to provide sufficient security against piracy in order to achieve stability in the region and worldwide. The international community and regional countries should agree on means that can be taken by each respective state individually and collectively. Maritime safety is considered an essential element of  economic security for Arab countries and the rest of the world, and therefore the Arab world should support and back international and regional joint efforts. Such regional endeavors to protect maritime shipping lanes from any threat including piracy, in addition to capacity building of maritime security workers, all represent the core of bilateral and multilateral partnership among concerned maritime organizations and Arab states. Because of this it is important for Arab states to expand their diplomatic relations regionally and internationally on the basis of enhancing their security capabilities, including access to necessary training, joint naval maneuvers, and keep up with international maritime developments.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=114942
114861	3	Oil Production and Consumption: Strategies for the UAE/	Dargin, Justin,	The Arabian Gulf region has the most prodigious energy reserves in the world. As of 2012, it contained 489.4 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, approximately 36 percent of global supply. The latest figures for 2012 indicate that the region collectively produced 17.3 million barrels per day (m/bpd). With the advantage of enormous oil reserves and small, albeit growing, populations, the region exports the majority of its oil production. The region holds approximately 42 trillion cubic meters (TCM) of natural gas, about 23 percent of global natural gas reserves, but it only produces about 8 percent of the total global production. With the exception of Qatar, most Gulf countries consume the majority of their natural gas production. It is estimated that at current production rates, the official oil reserves will last another 70 years and natural gas reserves another 118 years. In terms of the UAE, it has approximately the seventh largest proven oil reserves in the world, at 97.8 billion barrels, which represents approximately 7 percent of the total global proven oil reserves. The majority of the oil reserves are located in Abu Dhabi (approximately 94 percent), while the other six emirates in aggregate contain just 6 percent of the UAE{u2019}s oil reserves, with Dubai having the second largest reserves at 4 billion barrels.  This monograph focuses on the most efficacious methods for the UAE to buttress its oil production while reducing its oil and natural gas consumption. It recommends that the UAE create a tiered strategy of increasing oil output by utilizing alternative methods of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) that would not depend upon natural gas, such as CO2 EOR, nitrogen flooding and solar thermal EOR.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=114861

The 27 papers presented in this seminar by Emiratis and former British officials, provide a unique insight into the life and times in the Emirates during the decades of the 1950s, 60s and 70s. The narratives recounted by the Emiratis of their struggles and sacrifices that paved the path for the evolution of modern UAE, remain an inspiring legacy for generations to come. Added to their narratives, are the vivid reminiscences of British diplomats, officials and professionals who lived and served in the Emirates in a crucial era which initiated the dramatic transformation of the country. Of exceptional value to this book, are the myriad vintage pictures from the personal collections of the contributors. Memoirs of the Emirates adds a new dimension to the history and heritage of this nation by bringing to light individual recollections and reminiscences that are not to be found in the official records or documents.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=114650

109684	3	Technology and the future of energy /		Energy plays a key role in realizing sustainable development in both advanced and developing countries alike, and it is therefore vital that investment in technological development be sustained in order to maximize the benefits of currently available energy resources. However, the question as to how that investment should be directed is a contentious one, and involves numerous parallel questions relating to efficiency, resource availability, cost effectiveness and environmental impact, among others. Furthermore, uncertainty remains as to the extent to which technological innovation can satisfy future global energy requirements, regardless of the future energy balance.  The ECSSR 18th Annual Energy Conference, Technology and the Future of Energy, held at the Center on November 12{u2013}13, 2012, and the resultant papers compiled in this volume, provide a variety of informed views on current and future technological trends in the energy industry, and their consequences for both producers and consumers.  They present a strategic outlook for technological development in the industry, based on analysis of global energy supply and demand, current and future investment trends in energy technology, the potential impact of technological advances in the oil and gas industry, and the viability of alternative energy technologies. Also discussed are technological challenges and opportunities in energy-intensive sectors in the oilproducing countries of the Arabian Gulf.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109684
109683	3	Global energy markets : | changes in the strategic landscape /		The impact of the changing global strategic landscape on energy markets is being felt across the world, and is the subject of ongoing debate within industry and governments alike. These changes not only affect the evolution of oil markets and their influence on production rates and pricing, but also a host of other factors, including energy security, the effects of global economic crises, and the growing market presence of Arabian Gulf producers, both in terms of their conventional reserves and their development of alternative and renewable sources.  The ECSSR 17th Annual Energy Conference, Global Energy Markets: Changes in the Strategic Landscape, held at the Center on November 1{u2013}2, 2011, and the papers compiled in this volume as a result, provide a variety of informed views on these trends and their consequences for both producers and consumers in the Middle East and elsewhere.  The effects of geostrategic developments on energy markets and the formulation of energy policies in the GCC states and abroad are explored in detail, as are the economic viability and outlook of renewable energy sources, both in light of CO2 emissions constraints and the involvement of Gulf hydrocarbon producers in the development of renewables. The potential benefits and risks of nuclear energy production are explored, as is public sentiment toward nuclear development worldwide{u2014}particularly following recent events in Japan, the repercussions of which continue to be felt both in politics and industry. The ongoing effects of the global economic crisis are also discussed, particularly with reference to their consequences for energy markets worldwide.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109683
109682	3	Britain and the administration of the Trucial States, 1947-1965 /	Alhammadi, Muna M.       ,	For over 150 years, from 1820 up to the foundation of the United Arab Emirates in 1971, Britain and the emirates of the eastern Arabian Peninsula were linked by a relationship that was unique when compared to colonial models exercised elsewhere.  From the signing of the General Treaty with the Arab Tribes of the Gulf in 1820, through to the oil and aviation concession agreements penned during the mid- to late-20th century, formal treaties and agreements with the rulers of the various emirates formed the basis of Britain{u2019}s long influence in the region, and are discussed in detail in this study. It also explores the evolution of the area{u2019}s first security force in the early 1950s{u2014}the Trucial Oman Levies (TOL), which played a key role in the security and development of the emirates.  The study discusses in some detail the evolution of the Trucial States Council, from its formation in 1952, up to 1965 when the rulers of the emirates assumed the revolving chairmanship of the Council for the first time. Through its various committees, the Council played a critical role in overseeing the socio-economic development of the emirates, allocating and directing the developmental, medical and educational aid provided by Britain.  Through these focus areas, this book provides a unique analysis of the role played by Britain in the internal administration of the Trucial States up to 1965, offering both scholars and casual readers valuable insight into the early administrative developments which would ultimately form the foundations of the United Arab Emirates as a modern-day federation							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109682
109681	3	The oil era : | emerging challenges /		Economic, environmental and security considerations have hastened the need for diversification of energy resources. While oil remains a comparatively inexpensive form of energy and enjoys great demand {u2013} and which is therefore more strategically and economically important to the majority of countries worldwide than any other energy source {u2013} its future as a major and essential source of world energy remains uncertain in light of the decline of strategic reserves and the adverse effects of fossil fuels on the climate and environmental security. This is particularly significant given the limited application of other energy resources, which are unlikely to be sufficient in meeting increasing demand stemming from population growth, ongoing urban expansion and ever-higher rates of economic and social development.   It is hard to escape the conclusion that the international competition for sources of energy will be more severe and frenzied in the years ahead, and that the military dimensions of this competition will become more pronounced. These trends are likely to gain momentum so long as the worldwide demand for imported petroleum continues to grow and the supply of exportable oil fails to expand proportionately. Under these circumstances, it becomes essential to accelerate the development of alternative sources of energy and to increase the efficiency of oil-powered systems, thereby reducing the need for imports. As much as is possible, these efforts should be undertaken in a cooperative manner, so as to reduce the risk of unintended conflict over contested sources of energy.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109681
109680	3	Discovery of Israel's Gas Fields and their geopolitical Implications /	Craig, Alan,	Lying some 150 kilometers from Israel{u2019}s northern shoreline, these fields combined are believed to hold gas reserves of 25 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas. Together with smaller finds, it is estimated that Israel will have enough gas to meet total gas domestic needs for power generation over the next three decades and still accrue at least $140 billion in export earnings from the surplus produced.  For a nation that for so long endured a total Arab oil embargo {u2013} as well as a secondary boycott from multi-national energy corporations unwilling to invest in exploration of Israel{u2019}s coastal waters, lest it damage investment and contracts in oil-producing states across the Middle East {u2013} these finds, according to the Financial Times mean that 2Israel today stands on the cusp of an economic revolution, fuelled by the vast riches below its waters.3  However, aside from this prospective boon to the Israeli economy, this gas bonanza would also appear to be timely. In the light of the Arab Spring and the emerging security vacuum in the Sinai, Egyptian gas sales to Israel {u2013} fixed at a subsidized rate by an agreement reached with the previous Mubarak regime in 2005 {u2013} have now been terminated following a dozen sabotage attacks on the pipeline in the northern Sinai over a period of 18 months.  Such attacks are seen in Israel as a true measure of wider anti-Israel sentiment across Egyptian society, not least because the deal was negotiated by the Mubarak regime at a time when gas shortages continued to blight day-to-day life across Egypt. Until supplies from the recent gas fields can be realized in the Israeli market, the cost of energy for Israelis has continued to rise exponentially as power stations have been forced to revert to imported fuel oil, heavy oil and diesel to meet immediate shortfalls.  Other distant problems {u2013} some geopolitical, others internal {u2013} threaten to cloud the otherwise bright energy horizon. Given the location of the Leviathan field in particular, Lebanon has raised objections, arguing its riches fall partially within its own declared Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the eastern Mediterranean.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109680
109679	3	The Future of Intelligence in the 21st century /	Birdsall, Mark,	Many people believe intelligence is simply a generic term for information. It is not; it is far more important. The intelligence process is the result of raw data or information sourced from a multitude of areas. Therefore, intelligence is of paramount importance to all governments and it is a very valuable commodity. In an uncertain and changing world, its true value cannot be accurately appraised until it is tested. Intelligence is not the sole domain of government but is used by everyone in decision making. However, in this research paper I focus only on that which is sought after and utilized by officialdom, which means examining the world of secret intelligence as seen by services and organizations such as MI6 or the CIA. Intelligence has never been more in demand; nor has it ever been more complex and difficult to manage. The world of intelligence is a mosaic of puzzles and is often misunderstood by the public. However, events over the last 20 years such as 9/11, the London bombings, terrorist attacks in Mumbai, Bali and elsewhere, reveal why it is so important that governments should have an intelligence system. Such events also thrust the subject of intelligence into the public gaze. Terrorism is simply one element that the world{u2019}s intelligence services seek information on, but it could be argued that at this moment it is the most important.  Organizations such as MI6 are made up of directorates that are charged with various tasks, from counter-espionage to monitoring the shipping lanes off the Horn of Africa. Nations such as the United States have intelligence systems that incorporate and link dozens of large and small executive agencies and all play a role{u2014}from the port authority to border agencies, counter-intelligence and the domestic security service better known as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The United States Intelligence Community (USIC) is immense, and has the ability to react quickly, operate globally and interact with its allies. The United States is but one player in this fascinating industry and most modern nations have intelligence systems in place. Yet size does not necessarily guarantee success; functionality, finance, adaptability, resources, technical support and experience are all important factors.  Described as the world{u2019}s {u2018}second oldest profession,{u2019} espionage was born from the often desperate need of our ancestors to find out what our adversary or enemy or neighbor was doing or preparing. Intelligence therefore, has been sought after and used for thousands of years, especially in times of conflict. This research paper endeavors to predict what the world of intelligence may look like later this century. To simply hypothesize or second guess makes no sense, there are far too many imponderables; yet there are clues emerging today, and trends from yesteryear that we can examine {u2013} as well as incidents that have changed history {u2013} and analyzing this information could provide a useful and compelling insight.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109679
109678	3	The Strategic Dynamics of the Indian Ocean /	Sakhuja, Vijay,	The Indian Ocean region is a large maritime-littoral space of geo-political, geo-economic and geo-strategic significance. It is characterized by globalization, maritime trade, extra regional naval presence, asymmetric actors and non-traditional security challenges arising from climate change and natural disasters. Significantly, economics and security has been the significant feature of transactions that have shaped the historical and contemporary discourse in the region. In its historical geo-economic construct, the Indian Ocean facilitated links among the ancient trading systems of the Mediterranean, Arabian Peninsula and the Asia. There is a strong element of continuity and in the 21st century trade and energy flows link the Indian Ocean region to the global economies of the Asia{u2013}Pacific, Europe and North and South America.  In its geo-strategic construct the Indian Ocean region has been an arena for rivalry between the great powers and in contemporary times the region continues to be of strategic significance to the United States, European powers, China, India and Japan whose forces are forward deployed in support of strategic and economic interests. At the functional{u2013}operational level, several extra regional navies are deployed in the Indian Ocean in support of the war on terror and to counter piracy off Somalia. In essence, the Indian Ocean region emerges as an arena of competition and cooperation and it is in this context that this paper attempts to examine its strategic dynamics.  It begins by mapping the Indian Ocean and highlights the significant physical characteristics of this body of water which shape the geo-political, geo-economic and geo-strategic discourse followed by a brief historical narrative that showcases the continuity in the importance of the Indian Ocean from ancient times into the 21st century. Given these realities, it is argued that extra regional powers have exhibited a strong penchant to steer the political{u2013}economic{u2013}strategic dynamics of the Indian Ocean. Despite the apprehension of regional countries of this extra regional reality, some have been supportive of their presence. At another level, the non-traditional threats and challenges confronted by the Indian Ocean littorals are examined and proposals offered for maritime multilateralism to be a tool for states to develop cooperative mechanism for building mutual trust and confidence.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109678
109661	3	Political Outcomes of the Global Financial Crisis /	Deford, Thomas M. ,	Gauging future political outcomes as a result of the global financial crisis is more of an art than a science. The global financial crisis will certainly have direct political effects across the globe, and indeed, already has, for example the government changes over the last several years across the European Union. If economies stay depressed, especially in Greece, such widespread discontent may well be the proverbial {u2018}tip of the iceberg{u2019}. However, there were other global influences already at work before the financial collapse, which will have equally wide-ranging political effects.  Certainly global warming, as demonstrated by violent storms and melting ice caps, will play havoc on the international scene. A report issued in the last quarter of 2012 by the United States{u2019} top scientific research group, the National Research Council, outlined the variety of different areas {u2013} water supply, food markets, energy supply chains and public health systems {u2013} that will be severely affected over the next decade by global warming. Population is another issue that could affect global political interests in unforeseen ways. In coming years, as the National Research Council{u2019}s report noted, the mixture of exploding Third-World populations and the negative impacts of global warming could be a volatile mixture. Yet in developed countries, ironically, it is population decline that could cause political instability.  What political changes are already under way? Considering that the crisis has caused the most severe recession in the West since the Great Depression, there has been perhaps less political fallout than might have been expected. The Eurozone has seen a number of center-right governments replaced by more leftist ones, but there{u2019}s also been some conservative reaction as well. Public dissatisfaction and demonstrations {u2013} especially in Greece and to a lesser extent in Spain and Italy {u2013} are growing but the social safety nets have, at least so far, ameliorated the public reaction. In the United States, the majority of Americans believed the economy had turned the corner, so no matter how bad the situation remained, it was improving and that was enough to re-elect Obama. In the Middle East I remain decidedly pessimistic about Syria, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Iraq and Iran. By contrast, the United Arab Emirates seems to have weathered the global financial crisis with its economy intact while escaping the political instability which surrounds it.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109661

109628	3	Negative social outcomes of the Global financial crisis /	Agrrawal, Pankaj,	The collapse of the housing sector began towards the end of 2006 and in the three years since then, about 2.5 million foreclosures have already taken place. The loss of a home or the threat of that loss can be extremely destabilizing for individuals, especially those with limited safety nets, such as the 46 percent of US households with less than $5,000 of liquid assets or the 52 percent of employees living paycheck to paycheck. One study shows that families facing foreclosure experienced high rates of depression, marital discord and declines in academic performance. The forced relocations often have a disproportionately adverse effect on children and seniors who find themselves uprooted from their social networks and transplanted into unfamiliar settings. Such levels of stress can initiate a vicious cycle of health problems, mental issues and loss of earnings.  While the literature on suicides as a response to stress is extensive, the number of studies directly linking suicides, homicides and murder{u2013}suicides to the global financial downturn is somewhat limited. The availability heuristic is partly to blame for this, since homicides are reported with greater frequency than suicides and the relative recency of the financial crisis and the difficulty of tracking evicted individuals in the time{u2013}space dimension may have additionally contributed to this topic staying under the radar.  However, European medical researchers find increases in unemployment to be accompanied with higher suicide rates and a lower availability of transplant organs, presumably from an associated drop in road accidents (10{u2013}25 percent drop) during periods of economic slowdown. Their findings also indicate that health consequences of financial crises are {u2018}rapid,{u2019} implying that suicides would rise even before a crisis becomes full blown since victims anticipate hardship and the inevitable loss of employment. An increase in the incidence of suicides, murders and joint suicide{u2013}murders was noted in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis. Contrary to general belief a significant number of these fatalities occurred among the higher income group and those working in the finance sector.  No economic system can afford such a direct loss of human capital. Policy and strategy has to be formulated to prevent such negative outcomes of financial meltdowns, which are bound to recur.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109628
109622	3	Geostrategic solutions to oil vulnerabilities in the Gulf Region /	Shikara, Ahmad.	For the foreseeable future, oil and gas will continue to be major determining geostrategic factors in the process of maintaining security and stability in the Arabian Gulf region. Oil vulnerabilities will continue to be a source of concern both in the region and abroad as long as fossil fuel sources occupy the largest share of the global energy mix. What is apparent, however, is that the largest international consumer of oil (the United States) has yet to devise a comprehensive solution to these vulnerabilities, and other countries are facing their own challenges in finding viable alternative options. This paper intends to explore new models of global governance in producer{u2013}consumer relations to ameliorate the adverse effects of oil vulnerabilities such as supply disruptions or 2peak oil3 scenarios. The paper will also seek to answer some vital questions regarding energy security, encompassing oil resource availability, reliability, affordability, and sustainability. In particular, it seeks to address the following questions, issues and concerns:  Is there a clear strategic vision for overcoming oil vulnerabilities in the Arab Gulf? And if not, is there a need for one?  How might major oil vulnerabilities involving transportation {u2018}choke points{u2019} and critical infra-structure be overcome (id est operational mechanisms)?  To what extent do current geo-political strategies or alternative energy options represent realistic propositions? This requires a cost{u2013}benefit analysis: if fossil fuel sources are affordable, will there be viable long-term opportunities to achieve the energy diversification called for in strategic planning?  What innovative strategies may be employed to overcome oil vulnerabilities in the region? Such strategies should be based on global governance and a well-structured protocol of inter-dependent partnerships between producers and consumers.  Owing to the unpredictability of geopolitical events in general, and in the Middle East in particular, it is difficult to envision the creation of a sustainable energy security strategy to suit both producers and consumers. Nonetheless, it is vital that a dynamic and pragmatic strategy be formulated to avert or mitigate oil vulnerabilities{u2014}be it on a multilateral, bilateral or national level.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109622
109616	3	Turkey and Iran : | approaches to engagement in the Middle East /	Keyman, Emin Fuat,	From the recent tensions in the relationship between Turkey and Iran, a thorny path awaits Turkish-Iranian affairs, unless Iran chooses to focus not on diverging self-interests, but a cooperative policy with Turkey to promote peace and stability in the region. But this alternative future might be fading due to current debacles. Turkish-Iranian relations came under significant strain with the escalation of tensions in Syria and also took a steep plunge after two other events with significant impact on the region{u2019}s security. The first incident came with Turkey{u2019}s acceptance to join the NATO missile shield program, and in 2011 Ankara decided to allow NATO{u2019}s early warning anti-missile radar system to be set up in the town of Kürecik, Southeastern Turkey, as part of the NATO capability. At that time, Turkey was criticized for turning her face to the East, although this was purely economic development; however, the decision to allow an anti-missile system on Turkish soil was an indication that Turkey is still close to her Western alliance.  One should also never lose sight of that in Turkish-Iranian relations, Turkey{u2019}s maneuver area in the East{u2013}West pendulum affords Turkish foreign policy a rare flexibility. Unlike the Turkish case, Iran{u2019}s animosity towards the West denies Tehran such flexibility in its foreign relations. Furthermore, Iran{u2019}s resistance to the Arab uprisings and the way in which it deals with its own domestic situation introduces a curious ontological discussion. In fact, in the aftermath of the Arab uprisings, the Mullah regime has been confronted by a deeper crisis than is visible from outside.  The recent tension that we have observed in Turkish-Iranian relations is in fact a projection of this crisis. The fact that Turkey will always maintain its Western identity means that a new status quo in Turkish-Iranian affairs will never develop until Iran confronts and settles its domestic discontent. Iran is at a fundamental crossroads today. The foreign policy decisions that Tehran will take is going to have irrevocable ramifications for the region and its partners. If the Iranian regime chooses to follow a more cooperative foreign and regional policy, the stability and prosperity blanket that Turkey has weaved will create a conducive environment for Iran to merge its capacity with others and work towards the common welfare of the region. However, if Tehran opts for nation building and sectarian policies, the regime will risk the deterioration of its constructive relations with steadfast patrons and partners like Turkey.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109616
109606	3	Iran : | internal narratives and real security challenges /	Lindemann, Thomas,	Why have Iranian actors displayed such aggressive behavior over the past decade, and especially since 2005? Why did Iranian perestroika fail? For a certain time now, Iranian behavior on the international scene has been characterized by military threats and deterrence postures, rhetorical intimidations of Israel, hints at military nuclearization, and assistance for 2revolutionary3 agitation in states with Shiite majorities. Many explanations have been offered for these variations in Iranian foreign policy behavior, such as profit motives, security opportunities brought about by the spread of technology, or 2American encirclement3 of Iran by troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. While these explanations have some merit, they do not answer some intriguing key questions: why is it that Iranian decision-makers declare themselves to be a great nuclear power and threaten Israel before actually being able to employ this nuclear deterrent? And why is Iran emphasizing nuclearization in spite of the high economic costs (e.g., in the form of sanctions) linked to this option?  In contrast to other researchers, my analysis will elucidate these puzzles by giving more importance to narratives of 2self-aggrandizement3 in Iranian decision-making{u2014}by this I mean inflated presentations of one{u2019}s own cohesion and strength, employing strong images of the 2enemy.3 The creation of such myths has the function of re-invigorating the country`s decision-makers self-esteem while at the same time enhancing their internal legitimacy. As the re-evaluation of the 2self3 is not an isolated process, but related to other engaging actors, these myths also involve the demonization of other significant international actors (in this case, the United States).  This study will establish and illustrate the co-variation between the US stigmatization of Iran and the radicalization of Iran{u2019}s internal narratives and foreign policy. The first part will outline the historical variations in Iranian foreign policy and its approach to international politics. In particular, it will argue that nuclear policy and rhetoric has been used to construct a positive self-image of an internationally isolated Iran. The second part will show that these chronological variations in internal Iranian narratives and foreign policy approaches are linked to the US and European framing of Iran, arguing that it is Iran{u2019}s stigmatization as a 2rogue state3 which has contributed to the rise of narcissistic self-descriptions that depict Western international powers as evil.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109606

109592	3	Global financial instability and implications for the GCC /	Rubin, Jonathan,	Many aspects of the global economic crisis remain unclear, especially the ability of the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) to reduce their operating deficits and debt. In particular, one major concern for those focused on climate change is the extent to which the financial crisis has impacted the United States{u2019} and EU{u2019}s ability and willingness to invest in and help develop renewable energy technology around the world.  This is a serious concern since there is now a consensus that climate change is human-induced. Equally important, there is a need to reduce the non-climate impacts of energy generation, provide employment, and reduce global poverty.  According to the International Monetary Fund for the period 2000{u2013}2009, fiscal dependency in the majority of GCC nations increased from the previous decade whereby hydrocarbons account for almost 90 percent of revenues and 80 percent of exports (hydrocarbon exports as a share of total exports). This increase in dependency on hydrocarbons comes from the increase in oil prices over the past decade. The exception to this trend in the GCC is the UAE where hydrocarbons have fallen to about 60 percent of total exports and their share in revenue has also fallen. While renewable energy to date in GCC nations is not large in terms of total installed capacity, very important plans and projects are now being put in to place. While each nation has specific circumstances, as a whole, the GCC has been able to adequately cope with the negative effects of the financial crisis with an expected 2012 growth rate of six percent for the region.  The UAE holds more than seven percent of the world{u2019}s total oil and three percent of proven natural gas reserves and is ranked the seventh in the world in both resources; most of the oil (94 percent) is in Abu Dhabi. Notwithstanding these oil and gas reserves, the UAE aims to produce seven percent of its electricity from renewables by 2020. Masdar, Abu Dhabi{u2019}s government-owned renewable energy firm, has the ambitious goal of making Abu Dhabi the preeminent source of renewable energy knowledge, development, implementation and the world{u2019}s benchmark for sustainable development.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109592
109587	3	The Global financial crisis : | impact on higher education /	Hunter, Susan J,	As with most sectors, higher education did not escape impact from the credit crisis caused by high-risk mortgage loans to individuals who could not afford to maintain the payments. The ensuing stock market crash created a cascade of loan defaults that produced portfolio declines of about 33 percent, creating a ripple effect throughout the entire economy. Because the majority of states were affected by the crisis, the United States Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in 2009. ARRA was a stimulus package and a portion of the funding was aimed at offsetting state budget cuts in the fiscal years 2009{u2013}2012. By the beginning of 2011, most of the ARRA funds had been depleted by states, so it is likely that they will not have federal funds to mitigate impacts occurring in future years. At least 43 of the 50 states have cut assistance to public universities since 2009, although states have been unevenly affected by the crisis. Overall appropriations for higher education decreased 3.8 percent nationwide between 2007 and 2012.  The 2008 financial crisis resulted in a tightening of credit availability, making it more difficult for students to secure loans, which are commonly used to pay for higher education in the United States. Other forms of financial aid such as grant funding from the government also became scarcer. The combination of tough economic times and the inability to secure funding to pay for education caused some students to delay or discontinue higher education. The financial crisis also affected student decisions on where to attend college. Students began searching for more affordable options, such as staying in their home state and attending public institutions or choosing a community or technical college.  Across Europe, the effects of the financial crisis on higher education systems were expressed unevenly, with some countries reporting increases in funding for research and teaching while others reported budget cuts greater than 10 percent. Higher Education in Asian countries was also affected unevenly by the crisis. UNESCO reported that some Asian countries successfully implemented stimulus packages and other forms of government assistance to lessen the impact of the crisis on higher education.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109587
109572	3	The Global financial crisis and its economic repercussions/	Breece, James H. ,	There has been much attention by the media recently about the causes for the 2007 financial collapse that occurred in the United States, Europe, and other parts of the world, and its linkage to the historic recession that followed. Much of the world was greatly impacted by these disturbances directly or indirectly, and therefore it is necessary to discuss the transmission mechanism that transformed the financial crisis into an economic crisis, or what some would say from 2Wall Street to Main Street.3 This chain of events has global implications, with different countries and regions feeling the implications differently depending on the level of integration of their financial, labor, and goods and services markets. This textbook chain of events is what took place during 2007 and 2008 to transform the financial crisis into an economic crisis in the United States. However, the real question is not so much about the chain of events that occurred, but rather why the financial crisis and the resulting economic crisis were as severe as they were, both in terms of duration and magnitude. Although recessions occur about every five years, the world has never experienced such a deep or prolonged economic recession such as this, lasting 18 months (where the average duration is 11 months). Consequently, many refer to this recession as the {u2018}great recession.{u2019}  The purpose of this paper is to explore the underlying causes for the magnitude and duration of the great recession and why it spread so far. The supposition of this paper is that the root causes for the severity of the recession were structural shifts in the global and US economies that have been brewing for many years if not decades, and were not based on short-term influences from the business cycle (which may have been responsible for the timing of the recession). Many of these structural shifts should have been detected beforehand and could have been acted upon to prevent, or at least minimize, the devastation that occurred. More importantly, if these trends are not acted upon now and reversed, the United States and European nations may be threatened again by future reoccurring recessions. The events leading up to the financial and economic crises are what I call the making of the {u2018}perfect economic storm.{u2019}							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109572
109568	3	The Global financial crisis : | political and social unrest/	Warhola, James W. ,	After reviewing various themes in classical Greco-Roman and Islamic political thought pertaining to political stability and accountability, this analysis considers large-scale patterns of political unrest and conflict in the late-modern world, particularly as they manifest within the larger political context of the modern, so-called global {u2018}Westphalian system{u2019} of nation-states. One of the most primal functions of government {u2013} provision of security {u2013} must be taken into consideration if the political effects of the global financial crisis are to be even partly understood.  One of the brighter aspects of the late-modern human condition is the remarkable decline in incidence of inter-state conflict since the mid-20th century. Despite the seeming plethora of wars, international violence, and apparently chronic instability in some regions of the world, the objective fact is that there has been a remarkable, global decrease in inter-state conflict since the end of WWII. As an unfortunate counterpoint to the previous point, there was a dramatic increase in the number and frequency of civil wars, or within-country conflicts, during the second half of the 20th century. In some respects this might be viewed as a derivative of the {u2018}gelling{u2019} of the Westphalian system of nation-states during the entire 20th century. Much of the proliferation of nation states came during the Cold War, when the Atlantic Alliance/Soviet Bloc rivalry had an oddly stabilizing global effect regarding inter-state conflict. There was a striking increase in the incidence of ethnic-based conflict in the second half of the 20th century. Although the apparent rate of 2onset of new societal wars3 has remained constant, the type of those societal wars appears to have shifted somewhat from predominantly ethnic-type conflicts to conflicts having a religious dimension.  If there is an underlying, common denominator it appears to be the marginal or absent degree of political accountability by national leaderships, combined with a failure of the international community to intervene in cases where doing so would be not only morally justifiable, but compelling on pragmatic grounds of prevention of conflict-escalation.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109568
109539	3	Economics and politics in a volatile world /	Kołodko, Grzegorz W.	We are currently dealing with a global financial crisis far more serious than just a temporary drop in business activity and a decline in absolute production levels. Traditionally, these have been measured using Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and this measure should be gradually abandoned and replaced by the superior measures of sustainable social and economic development. It is true that globally it is the most extensive crisis in the post-war period{u2014}that is a timespan of three generations. However, it is an intellectually and politically unacceptable simplification to identify the current crisis as a temporary recession.  We began the first decade of the 21st century in improving economic conditions and a decent rate of economic growth. During the first three years of this decade, Gross World Product (GWP) increased in total by 9.6 percent, with an average annual growth of 3.1 percent. This acceleration was visible also in subsequent periods, particularly in the three years preceding the crisis. In 2005{u2013}2007, the GWP increased by 15.5 percent, which means an average annual growth of more than 4.9 percent. Later, there followed the slowdown and the crisis of 2008{u2013}2010 when GWP increased by barely 4.9 percent, which means an annual average of 1.6 per century During the three crisis years, the total GWP value corresponded to a one-year value of the years preceding the crisis. Someone looking from the sidelines might ask: why so much panic just because in 2009 the production level dropped by just one percent?  Firstly, in the case of the developing countries inhabited by 5.8 billion people, the index was 4.3 percent. Secondly, the present day crisis is more one of redistribution rather than of production. Thirdly, tendencies present in the financial markets, such as positive movements expressed in the increase of stock exchange quotations, are by no means a sign of the economy coming back to "normal." Fourthly, following disturbances in production and trade there is a fall in employment, which is automatically followed by a rise in the unemployment rate and continues to increase during the phase when the global economy starts to emerge from recession. The fifth, and I believe the most important factor, is that the present crisis is a fundamental one{u2014}a systemic crisis. It is not just another case {u2013} no matter how spectacular or interesting {u2013} that is simply related to the business cycle.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109539

The English version of 'Spirit of the Union' book presents a valuable in-depth view into the historical narration by Shaikh Mohammed who stood witness to pivotal junctures on the path to realising the dream state some 40 years ago. Through his companionship with the late Shaikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and the late Shaikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Shaikh Mohammed's testimony authenticates and corrects important historical facts and sheds light on undocumented details and challenges that stood in the way of establishing the union. The 'Spirit of the Union' book in Arabic was well received by Emirati nationals, intellectuals, researchers and residents alike as it presented an invaluable recounting of history from which lessons can be drawn on how leaders tackle challenges in their quest of a higher cause.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109482

109432	3	Islam and the west : | a civilized dialogue /		The interaction between the Muslim World and the West stretches back centuries and although the points of conflict are well known, the exchange of knowledge and cultural awareness cannot be under-estimated and their impact on both civilizations is palpable. Recent historical events have once again focused attention on perceived points of conflict and their associated negative connotations and the resultant criticisms and stereotypes of the West and Islam in general. By reaching back to the past we can sometimes find a way to pursue a more peaceful future, and past examples of cooperation and co-existence between the West and the Muslim World {u2013} if the historical context and perspective of these periods is taken into account {u2013} can offer a path to mutual understanding and respect. If we take the positive from the past and promote what we hold in common today, then the noise of extremism will always be held at bay.  In order to examine these issues and provide an in-depth overview of the relationship between the West and the Muslim World, the Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research (ECSSR) held a Symposium under the title 2Islam and the West: A Civilized Dialogue,3 on May 16{u2013}17, 2011 in Abu Dhabi, hosting a group of distinguished experts from various academic, political and educational backgrounds in conjunction with the School of Policy and International Affairs at the University of Maine, United States. This book comprises a valuable collection of the papers presented at the Symposium. It identifies how relations between the West and the Muslim World have developed; where mutual interests meet and diverge; and prospects for peaceful co-existence. This book draws on the in-depth knowledge and varied opinions of its contributors who share a wealth of experience in all facets of inter-cultural awareness, European and Islamic history, contemporary international relations, media and education, and includes experts native to the Muslim World and the West as well as those who have chosen both regions as their adoptive homes.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109432
109431	3	Turkish foreign policy and its regional implications /	Altunisik, Meliha Benli,	Turkey{u2019}s Middle East policy has transformed in recent years and is now more involved in the region, employs more soft power tools and actively engages in third party roles in regional conflicts. Turkey has improved its relations with bordering states as a result of its 2zero problems with neighbors3 policy. This paper examines the elements of a new Turkish foreign policy in the Middle East and focuses on the reasons for its evolution as well as its structural conditions and political leadership. In discussing these factors this paper aims to identify the circumstances that have created an opening for change. It is argued that those structural conditions which emerged at the beginning of the new millennium coincided with a strategic political leadership that led to this transformation.   It is also emphasized that 2pull factors3 have been important for a new Turkish engagement with the Middle East. Perspectives on Turkey in the region have become more positive in recent years. However, different actors in the Arab world have different perceptions of Turkey and its importance for the region. Some focus on Turkey as a strategic asset in the constantly shifting and highly volatile regional balance of power, while others perceive Turkey more as an important economic partner and critical for the debates on political reform in the region. Finally, this paper focuses on the issue of sustainability of Turkish foreign policy in the Middle East in the face of certain challenges, especially the so-called 2Arab Spring3, which has presented difficulties for Turkey in light of the instabilities in various Arab countries and has challenged Turkey{u2019}s political and economic interests.   The AKP government{u2019}s policy towards the region has therefore been evolving and during its first term it positioned itself outside of the polarizations and conflicts in the region and firmly tied its policy to the EU accession process. Such a policy was not only good for Turkey {u2013} providing political and economic opportunities {u2013} it was also beneficial for the Middle East. However, since 2008 the AKP government{u2019}s policy has begun to shift slightly and Turkey would appear to have become more involved in regional polarizations, particularly in relation to Israel and Iran. The weakening of the EU anchor has further contributed to Turkey{u2019}s entanglement in the Middle East and the challenge now for Turkey has grown since the geo-political conditions that made Turkey more active in the region have changed. Ultimately, the success of Turkish diplomacy in the Middle East will depend on how far it will manage to respond to the momentous transformations taking place in the region.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109431
109430	3	India-Pakistan Relations : | Common Ground and Points of Discord /	Ashraf, Sajjad,	Pakistan and India, the two largest countries in South Asia, share more than just a common border; they also share a common history, culture, language, and {u2013} at certain levels {u2013} a common ideology. Yet they remain enemies who have fought several wars, face seemingly insurmountable geographic issues, and co-exist amid discord on several fronts. However, there is reason to be hopeful when these issues have not eliminated the commonalities between the two parties.   While current state of affairs between India and Pakistan on a variety of fronts does not offer the most conducive environment for progress, even in this dismal situation there have been occasions and signs {u2013} and on a non-official level, large leaps forward {u2013} showing the impossibility of a complete shutdown in interactions.   Commonly understood languages {u2013} and perceptions {u2013} see these neighbors empathizing with each other thanks to their social conditioning and behavior, as well as their commonly held customs. This binds Indians and Pakistanis in a discourse that perhaps overrides all other identities.   Political pressures mean that Pakistan and India are unlikely to budge from their traditional positions and permit any perceptions that they have succumbed to pressure from the other side. Thus, any commitment should move beyond difficult and complicated issues and focus on the bigger picture. For Pakistan, that entails a recognition that unless it stabilizes its political processes and economic progress, it is likely to suffer chronic instability, while India should see its own interests and broader regional goals in Pakistan{u2019}s stability. Recognizing this as a win{u2013}win solution beyond pre-conceived notions and paradigmatic hostility will mean that the remaining battle will also be won. The two countries owe this to their nations, to their populations and to regional peace and prosperity; they owe this to their shared history and common culture, and to the casualties of 64 years of suffering. Ultimately, they owe this to the future of South Asia.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109430
109429	3	Iran's Expanding Relations with China and their Strategic Dimensions /	Dorraj, Manochehr,	As two great civilizations with a long history of economic and cultural ties that go back more than a millennia, Iran and China can find much in their past to celebrate their current expanding relations. The Silk Road that tied Iran, Central Asia and the Arab World to China established a significant legacy upon which the current relations rest. The fact that in more recent history the two nations also suffered under the humiliating conditions of neo-colonialism and experienced several revolutions in 20th century, in which the political themes of nationalism and anti-imperialism were ascendant, provides both sides with a sense of psychological identification. Equally significant in fostering bilateral relations has been the lack of any history of war and conflict between the two nations. Hence, unlike Western nations, China does not have a history of colonial dominance in the region. While this historical backdrop provides an important foundation, the real source of current expanding bilateral relations lie in a pragmatic calculus of national interests. Both countries find expanding trade and political ties to be mutually beneficial and complimentary to the expansion of their power and influence in the region and beyond.  In this paper the historical roots are analyzed, and the more recent political dynamics that shape the relationship, with a special emphasis on the post-1979 period; energy relations are examined, the sale of armaments, China{u2019}s assistance to the development of Iran{u2019}s nuclear program, trade relations, and political and strategic considerations that tie the two nations. In the context of the current political dynamics that govern this relationship, there is an attempt to shed light on how these dynamics impact the bilateral relations and the standing that both nations have with the United States. In this connection, China{u2019}s position is examined on Iran{u2019}s nuclear program, which epitomizes the delicate balancing act that Beijing is involved in, thereby hoping to maintain good relations with both antagonists{u2014}Iran and the United States. Finally, there is an analysis on the future direction of Iran{u2013}China relations.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109429
109428	3	Security Responses to Piracy in Southeast Asia, West Africa and Somalia /	Martin, Murphy N,	The pirates of Somalia have shaken the maritime world. They have mounted what amounts to the most substantial non-state threat to the security of international shipping for half a century and perhaps longer. Piracy outbreaks have also occurred in Southeast Asia and West Africa. In each case the international community has responded differently. What lessons can be learned from three different approaches and is it possible to distill lessons of international best practice that can be applied in the Gulf of Aden and the northern Arabian Sea?  This paper will examine how and why these three piracy outbreaks arose. It will describe in particular why the threat off Somalia grew so rapidly, why it declined and why the elements that made it successful remain in place. It will examine the responses of the international community, asking whether or not the response off Somalia might have been more effective if it had benefitted from stronger international backing and more coherent coordination. It will make the point that maritime security {u2013} the prevention and suppression of disorder at sea {u2013} must address many more issues than piracy as the theft of fish and the movement of drugs; weapons and people can often present greater risks.  It will build on this point by looking at maritime security developments drawn from all three regions that may be employed advantageously in the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea, before circling back to look at the fundamental problem, which is one of landward security and asking what initiatives have been taken to address this in Somalia and which ones appear to be yielding results. Finally, it will examine whether the way forward does lie with a unified global initiative, or if steps are better taken regionallycalling upon extra-regional support as necessary.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109428
109425	3	Piracy in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea /	Sakhuja, Vijay,	The contemporary discourse on maritime security is highly focused on asymmetric threats and challenges confronting the international community. Among these, terrorism and sea piracy have attracted greater attention. These issues have figured prominently in statements and speeches by the political leaderships across the globe and international organizations such as the United Nations, which have attempted to address it through a number of resolutions and conventions, and the national security strategy documents of several countries have incorporated these in their strategic calculations and operational doctrines. The international community has responded firmly to these threats and challenges through a number of political, diplomatic, security, legal and financial initiatives with positive results. Likewise, the international shipping industry has expressed concern about the threat of piracy and joined hands with the governments and instituted best business practices to protect ships against pirate attacks.  In recent times, the Gulf of Aden has witnessed a rise in incidents of piracy which has threatened sea-based commerce transiting though the area. There have been a number of hijackings, large sums of ransom money has been paid to the pirates for the release of crew, and perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the Somali piracy is that some crew members were killed due to non-payment of ransom. Furthermore, the Somali pirates have expanded their reach far and wide into the Indian Ocean including the Red Sea, Coast of Oman, Arabian Sea, waters around the Maldives, and the western seaboard of India. The shipping industry has urged the United Nations and national governments to take necessary action under various UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions to curb piracy, deploy naval assets and punish the criminals. Also a number of international initiatives and responses such as multinational naval operations, improved politico-diplomatic international cooperation, adoption of improved onboard security measures by the shipping companies, positioning of private security guards onboard ships, and a number of national legal reforms to address piracy have resulted in a decrease in the number of hijackings.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109425
109424	3	The prosecution of pirates in national courts /	Warner Robin,	Piracy is the oldest of the limited crimes subject to universal jurisdiction which are punishable by any state regardless of the nationality of the victim or perpetrator. Universal jurisdiction is generally reserved for crimes of an exceptionally serious and heinous nature and the placing of piracy in this category illustrates the extent to which piratical activities were seen as a widespread scourge. A customary international law regime was developed to respond to the threat of piracy in the 19th century. In the 20th century this was codified in the 1958 Convention on the High Seas (HSC) and the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), both of which contain provisions recognizing the universal jurisdiction of states to repress piracy and investigate and prosecute its perpetrators. The LOSC provisions are considered to be reflective of customary international law on piracy.  The significant upsurge in piracy incidents involving Somali nationals off the Horn of Africa, and in the Gulf of Aden since 2008, has led to increased scrutiny of piracy offences under international law; the incorporation of that law in national legislation; and the capacity of countries within and beyond the Horn of Africa region to investigate and prosecute these offences effectively. Somalia has been without a functioning central government for over two decades since the fall of the Siad Barre dictatorship in 1991. This lack of effective governance and enforcement of the rule of law in Somalia has provided the basic impetus for the increase in piratical attacks off the Somali coast.  This paper provides an analysis of the international legal framework for dealing with piracy and its criminalization in national legal systems. It examines some of the key trends emerging from national prosecutions of Somali pirates since the onset of increased piracy incidents off the Horn of Africa and in the Gulf of Aden, and the initiatives taken by the international community to strengthen the capacity of national legal systems in this region to investigate and prosecute piracy offences. Finally, it reviews the need for stronger criminal justice cooperation networks in the Horn of Africa and Gulf of Aden region to support investigation and prosecution of piracy offences							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109424
109423	3	Iraqi oil : | a potential shift in regional dominance /	Futhl Al-Deen, Dania Thafer,	Iraq is a conundrum. Its complexity can be understood by considering its location. It is a historically dynamic region situated on the Eurasian supercontinent at the junction of the Levant, Greater Persia, the Anatolian Peninsula and the Arabian Peninsula. This alone presents a wide range of social and political implications, which contribute to the materialization of a country that hosts divergent groups partitioned by religious and ethnic lines. Despite Iraq{u2019}s potential capacity of 12 million barrels per day (mb/d), it has only managed up to 3 mb/d since 1979.  One of the underlying reasons for this underproduction is the recurrence of war in contemporary times, but a current shaky {u2018}stability{u2019} may change this. The political and economic climate of today{u2019}s world is largely characterized by globalization and interdependence. An influx of supply and demand in one country may be reflected by changes in policies implemented by another.  Iraq{u2019}s recent forecasts in future oil production will play a significant role in an economic and political ripple of influence among its stakeholders{u2014}other oil-producing nations and importing nations. The projected increase of oil production by 9.6 mb/d to a total of 12 mb/d, as a result of new contracts, may potentially devastate prices. If this projection comes into fruition, it could redefine dominance in OPEC, significantly impacting the current oil hegemon, Saudi Arabia. This paper evaluates various scenarios for Iraq{u2019}s forecasted production level in an attempt to assess the most probable economic consequences within the context of the current political climate, through the application of the Supply-Demand Oil Model. We will evaluate three possible scenarios for oil production in Iraq from 2011 until 2017; the first scenario at the status quo; the second one at 50 percent of the forecasted amount; and the third production capacity at 100 percent, attaining 12 mb/d. Through comparative analyses of the primary characteristics that furnish Saudi Arabia with its dominance {u2013} superior spare capacity and leading production levels {u2013} we conclude that, in any scenario, it is unlikely for Iraq to become the dominant actor in OPEC by 2017.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109423

Shaikh Zayid Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the leader and the nation /		A detailed account of the personal charisma of the man and a deep commitment he had toward improvement of the quality of life of his people. The story of his quest that culminated in the establishment of the UAE Federation. Documentation of his unique capacities of leadership, intuitive political skill and resolute determination. New section as a retrospective on his achievements and the lasting legacy of his rule  Visionary statesmen who have created an enduring state edifice through purposeful consensus and persuasion remain a historical rarity. The formation of the United Arab Emirates on December 2, 1971 under the inspiring leadership of its founding father, H.H. Shaikh Zayid Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, is a unique example of the building of a prosperous nation that has earned its founder his rightful place among the outstanding statesmen of all time.   Against the backdrop of the British withdrawal from the Arabian Gulf region, it was H.H. Shaikh Zayid who accomplished the complex task of unifying the erstwhile Trucial States, creating the only thriving federal state in the Middle East. While fulfilling his personal destiny as the chosen leader, H.H. Shaikh Zayid strengthened the nation by uniting disparate tribal groups and sustained it against formidable challenges. He pioneered the modernization of the country and ultimately realized his dream of an effective framework for collaboration with neighboring Gulf states. The UAE has since become a constructive force within the region and beyond, exemplifying the principles of national unity, regional solidarity, international cooperation and religious tolerance.   This book adopts a scholarly approach in analyzing the UAE{u2019}s unique federal experience, its phenomenal achievements and H.H. Shaikh Zayid{u2019}s far-sighted policies. It is an in-depth study of the birth of a progressive nation and the pivotal role of its leader, based largely on unpublished historical records and documents. The factual foundation of the book and its meticulous documentation make it a valuable record covering an important era in the contemporary history of the Arab Gulf region.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=109163

108972	6	Moving towards a knowledge-based economy /		Between 2009 and 2011, the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development developed a comprehensive modelling capability for the Abu Dhabi economy. This study uses the modelling system to analyze the relative efficacy of alternative labour market policies, along with more general economic development policies. The policies analyzed are based on the economic policy priorities identified in the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 (the 2Vision3) which is a long-term planning document that was produced by the Abu Dhabi government to assist in guiding economic policy over the next two decades towards transition to Knowledge Based Economy.  The Vision also recognizes that a key policy to strengthen the Emirate{u2019}s economic future is social and human resources development. In fact, it is noted that social and human resource development is the 2pre-eminent objective and driving motivation behind all policies and initiatives3. With respect to the workforce, the Government{u2019}s aim is to 2ensure the availability of a stable supply of high quality labour and especially to encourage full employment among Nationals3. Hence, an ongoing economic policy focus is to develop improvements in the labour market.  In the study, four modeling scenarios have been developed to simulate the impact of key policies that are likely to be implemented as part of the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=108972

108689	3	Global strategic developments : | a futuristic vision /		The world today faces numerous challenges, including the ongoing fallout from the financial crisis and varied and diverse examples of violence and conflict across the globe. Combined with the many changes affecting both the regional and global balance of power {u2013} such as the apparent decline of the United States, the growing influence of the East, and the evolving role of international organizations {u2013} these challenges have led some to question how global power will be distributed in the coming two decades.   All nations are exposed to the influences of international policy and ongoing developments in the world order. Understanding these developments, as well as the associated implications for international security and stability, enables national policy makers to identify and capitalize on strategic opportunities.  A future strategic vision for the Gulf must encompass a range of issues, including internal, regional and global aspects. The states of the region must develop stronger domestic resilience by binding citizens to the state in a way that reduces its vulnerability to malign transnational forces. Gulf states will wish to further deepen their links to the countries of the East{u2014}particularly states such as South Korea, Japan, Australia, China and India, all of whom have different ways that they can contribute to regional stability. They may also wish to be exporters rather than merely importers of security, contributing to international missions authorized by the UN and other international bodies. States that have this sense of international social responsibility become more vital to the global system as a whole. The GCC states will also wish to revive and increase the flexibility of their regional security apparatus, perhaps to engage Iran, Iraq and Yemen, and gain more control of immediate regional dynamics. Driving regional security in this way will partly insulate the GCC countries from the diplomatic initiatives of others that may not be consistent with GCC interests. Furthermore, the GCC states will seek to build stronger institutional links among themselves, deepening the co-operation and contacts between the civil servants of the member countries so that diplomacy between them is derived from disciplined organizational procedures. Just as each state has to develop its domestic resilience, so through institution-building should the GCC strengthen its corporate resilience. Overall the Gulf states need to develop an increasingly global outlook, even as they deal with internal challenges. They must find more ways to engage productively in the broader security dialogue of the region, with outside actors from Europe, North America and Asia. In the age of globalization, the states of the region need to be very mindful of the place good governance has in ensuring that the rest of international society is able to effectively engage with the Gulf states.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=108689
108461	3	The Future of Inter-Arab Realtions/	Fahmy, Nabil,	When the dust of the last few years finally begins to settle, I believe that we will find an Arab World aware of these new realities and struggling to find common ground, even if it initially feels the discomfort of diversity. These are transformative and historic times, for we are redefining the identity and profile of the Arab World in the 21st century. As a result of this struggle, relations between Arab countries will ultimately be enhanced by life in a more open world, by better and more transparent governance that is accountable to the people, and by more inclusive and competitive political systems. These will not be simple choices between monarchies or republics{u2014}both can succeed or fail. These changes will take time and come at a human and material cost, but they will ultimately render a clearer vision of what the rest of the world may look like in the coming two decades, as well as highlight the importance of new and adaptive foreign policies. Whether in terms of new emerging powers, an inevitable shift in the flow of energy and food markets, issues of local and global environmental degradation, or the development of new and more sophisticated technologies.  As we navigate our course through these challenging times, the Arab World will witness serious change and evolving roles for different regional players. The future of the Arab World will not only be determined by the political transformations of the Arab Awakening, but also by globally occurring transformations. For a variety of historical, demographic, geographic, economic and political reasons, the countries that can particularly influence these changes will continue to be Algeria, Egypt, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. However, as our societies becomes more inclusive and more diversified, the role of every Arab state becomes even more important. Like the rest of the world, the Arab region will become more multipolar{u2014}a complicated but inevitable healthy transformation. Many only see darkness in the time ahead and I too must acknowledge the serious challenges before us. However, we must deal with today{u2019}s reality and its challenges; this is not a choice but an imperative. Despite such challenges, I see concrete opportunities to weave a more real and globally relevant, but much-changed Arab World in the decade to come. Most important, we must fight the urge to drift further apart out of fear of change; for change has been continuous and will always be inevitable.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=108461
107365	3	Water and Food Security in the Arabian Gulf /		This book comprises a valuable collection of the papers presented at the Symposium. The growing populations and economies have led to an increase in water demand around the globe. However, there are large variations in the amounts of water available to nations and regions, and growing concern surrounding the uncertainty associated with these supplies, due in large part to natural and human impacts on the water cycle.  The need for alternative sources of fresh water has also been aggravated by the large influx of guest workers and significant improvements in the quality of life among Gulf populations. Therefore supplies are augmented by alternative sources{u2014}mainly desalinization, which meets most of the needs of these countries. However, this comes at a great financial cost as it is an extremely energy intensive process and has associated security risks, but many still see desalination as the only viable means of ensuring water supply in the region. Global food security also faces an uncertain future. The Gulf states suffer from a substantial food gap, and all the countries of the region are net food importers. The increase in the region{u2019}s population, rising income levels, and harsh weather conditions that prevent the increase of local food production, have resulted in a vast increase in the region{u2019}s food imports.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=107365

106891	6	From pearls to oil : | how the oil industry came to the United Arab Emirates /	Heard, David,	From Pearls to Oil tells the story of the pre-war negotiations and explorations that led to the Emirates being the outstandingly wealthy and successful state that it is today. In the early 1930s few outsiders knew where Abu Dhabi was. That British expert on Arabia, H. St. John Philby, was dismissive of the Trucial Coast {u2013} 2These states owe their existence to piracy and pearls. They have no interest whatsoever in the great desert hinterland behind them. . .. [Their boundaries] might well be defined as extending from the coast to the usual three-mile limit at sea and, on the same analogy, to a similar three-mile limit from the coast inland3. (David Heard is quoting from a document and was unable to locate the original source. Can any reader of this review help?) The author carefully points out the close connection between the island of Abu Dhabi and the inland oasis villages of Buraimi/Al Ain as well as the authority successive sheikhs of Abu Dhabi have had over tribes that moved around over 100 miles from the sea. The negotiations were protracted. Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL) grew out of the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) and a number of distinct personalities came to the area to negotiate. Some had a sympathy for and understanding of the local authorities. David Heard{u2019}s own judgements of people vary according to how an individual empathised with the local people, respecting their customs and courtesies. The fascinating character Hajj Williamson is the British hero of the book. Williamson left Clifton College (where he was perhaps a contemporary of Sir Arnold Wilson) at the age of 13 and ran away to sea. He embraced Islam, was a fluent speaker of Arabic and scores high marks on the Heard scale. David Heard fantasises about him and the other British negotiators. Major Holmes and Brigadier Longrigg have their gin and tonic on a veranda of the PCL house in Dubai while Williamson sits with local Arabs on a carpet in the sand, sipping from tiny coffee cups and eating a rice dish with his fingers. Pearls to Oil From Pearls to Oil is a testament of the challenges contended by extraordinary men who initiated the search for oil in the United Arab Emirates, in the years between the two World Wars. The book features never-before-published copies of letters, notes and reports complementing the research, which itself stems from the archives of the Abu Dhabi Petroleum Company (ADPC) and other literature recorded by British Government officials. With rare photographs, maps and diagrams alongside the in-depth narrative, this book is a great asset for scholars, residents and visitors interested in the history of this land. -- Book Description Amazon.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=106891
106526	3	From Tribe to Facebook : | The transformational role of social networks /	Al-Suwaidi, Jamal S.    ,	The recent proliferation of social networks has led to a societal shift {u2013} from a tribal mentality to that of Facebook {u2013} and has served to connect people from around the world with common cultural, religious, political and economic characteristics in an unprecedented manner and with astonishing speed. When such vast numbers of individuals congregate via social networks, societies that were once imaginary become real {u2014} the virtual worlds they inhabit expand and instill in their {u2018}citizens{u2019} a shared desire to establish and enforce their common interests.  This study charts the impact of this phenomenon in order to explore and analyze the potential outcomes of the accelerated development of social networks. Their economic potential in general is discussed, as are their implications for the future of traditional media forms, both as sources of news and key platforms for shaping public opinion.  It also explores the use of social networks by terrorists and organized criminal gangs {u2013} a trend which has not only led to the development of new forms of criminal activity, but also to the {u2018}globalization{u2019} of crime {u2013} and examines the potential for new forms of {u2018}virtual{u2019} conflict to arise, with the Internet as the battlefield, social networks as the weapons, and states and citizens as the combatants.  In the area of domestic security, the study proposes that defense and intelligence agencies will depend on social networks to wage, and defend against various forms of information warfare, as well as to monitor the movements and communications of individuals under surveillance.  A major focus of the study is the growing ability of protestors and advocates of political change in countries with repressive regimes to create significant {u2018}virtual{u2019} political pressure through social networks, obtaining and disseminating information without censorship in a new {u2018}information democracy.{u2019} It is this role of social networks in the political and social make-up of nations that defines the importance of this study; particularly in view of the fact that social networks have recently become a vital variable in socio-economic mobility across the globe, and in the Arab world in particular.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=106526
103481	6	Rashid : | portrait of a ruler/	Wilson, Graeme,	Nelson Mandela once commented that it is 2better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership.3 Sheikh Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuaimi, Ruler of a tiny sheikhdom on the Arabian Peninsula, never operated on the same plain as the South African icon, but nevertheless he knew the dangers to which Mandela referred.  Rashid: Portrait of a Ruler is a story of leadership, the profound tale of a man who gave his life in the pursuit of progress. Growing up in the poverty of Arabia at the turn of a new century, the Ajman of Sheikh Rashid{u2019}s youth was a small, fishing and pearling village. As the son of the Ruler, he was born to lead during turbulent times. As Heir Apparent, the young sheikh grappled with holding together an embattled population amid the uncertainties of difficult times.   In 1928, Sheikh Rashid acceded as Ruler of Ajman. His unenviable task was about to get tougher. A combination of world economic collapse, and the advent of Japanese cultured pearls, would have a ruinous effect upon the Gulf{u2019}s economic staple. In 1929 the pearling industry collapsed. The people of the region were thrown into economic purgatory.     Amid these darkest of times, Sheikh Rashid fought to feed his people, rebuild his economy from scratch and guarantee the security of Ajman in trying times. That the Ruler of Ajman succeeded over subsequent, often deeply trying decades is displayed by the emergence of Ajman today. The first four decades of his rule were anything but easy. Rashid: Portrait of a Ruler portrays a leader whose existence revolved around a daily struggle for national survival. Through innovation and determination, Ajman slowly rebuilt itself and the people saw their lot improve. By the late-1960s Sheikh Rashid was in the winter of his life, but worked on to play a role in forging the United Arab Emirates. December 2, 1971, represented the culmination of a long career in public life.     In 1981, Sheikh Rashid passed away. Yet he left behind an enduring legacy in the form of his successor, Sheikh Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi. Under his leadership, Ajman has continued to prosper, evolving into one of the Arabian Peninsula{u2019}s investment hotspots.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=103481
103348	3	Turkish Relations with the Middle East/	Cook, Steven A. ,	Although it seems entirely appropriate for Turkey to want to broaden and deepen its relations with its neighbors and other countries in the Middle East, the shift in policy has been so dramatic that it led both Western and some Turkish observers to question whether Turkey was shifting away from its traditional Western foreign policy posture. The fact that the ruling party{u2019}s lineage can be traced back to the founding of Turkey{u2019}s Islamist movement in the late 1960s under the leadership of Necmettin Erbakan only accentuated concerns about Ankara{u2019}s efforts to forge a new path in the Middle East. After all, Turkey had long been a tepid and cautious observer of Middle Eastern politics, devoting most of its diplomatic energy on the institutionalization of relations with Europe and the United States. This Western orientation, especially Ankara{u2019}s NATO membership, was prior to the rise of the AKP a source of mistrust with which the Arab world tended to view Turkey. More profoundly, the combination of the Ottoman colonial legacy in the Middle East and Kemalism{u2019}s official policy of laiklik (secularism), which seemed to many in the Middle East as irreligious, sowed an unarticulated but unmistakable divide between Turkey and the Arab world.   Turkey{u2019}s new-found role in the Middle East will neither be as triumphant as some in Ankara suggest nor as malevolent as AKP{u2019}s Western opponents imply. There should be no doubt that Turkey is in the Middle East to stay. Still, Ankara{u2019}s hoped for role as a regional power broker may be in jeopardy as a result of the Arab Spring. This is not the consequence of early missteps on Libya and Syria, but because if Arab countries, especially Egypt, prove to be successful, Arabs will once again look within for leadership. As important as Ankara has been over the last decade, if Egypt regains its regional luster, Cairo will once again be the central locus of knowledge, cultural production and Middle Eastern political as well as diplomatic power. This is not to say that Turkey would return to a secondary role under such circumstances and its most enduring role in the Middle East is its ability to be the economic engine of the region. Indeed, the best way for Turkey to influence the trajectory of the Arab world undergoing unprecedented change is through its entrepreneurial spirit and willingness to invest in places where others may not. This may not be the grand vision that Erdoğan, Davutoğlu or other AKP leaders had in mind for Turkey in the region, but Turkey{u2019}s economic prowess may be the most important factor in ultimately achieving its goal of 2zero problems3 in the country{u2019}s immediate neighborhood.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=103348
103347	3	Currency Conflicts on the International Scene/	Driffill, John,	There has been discussion of {u2018}currency wars{u2019} for a number of years. The longest-running recent issue has been the persistent US current account deficit and the matching surpluses elsewhere in the world, particularly China. These {u2018}global imbalances{u2019} surfaced before 2000, and look set to continue for many years more, with little sign of the US deficit or Chinese surplus closing, despite some movement in the real exchange rate.  The issue is wider than this. In 2011 Japan took steps to limit the rise of the yen. There was concerted action by several central banks after the major earthquake in north-east Japan on 11th March 2011, and late in October 2011 Japan took unilateral action to prevent the Yen from rising further. In September 2011, the Swiss Central Bank imposed a ceiling on the value of the Swiss franc and a number of emerging economies whose exchange rates float freely, or relatively freely, and whose capital markets are fairly open, have complained that their currencies have become overvalued because international capital, looking for returns, has flowed into their economies. Brazil has taken steps to limit the rise of the Real. Other South American countries, including Chile and Peru, have been intervening in the last year to prevent what they see as excessive appreciation. Global imbalances and currency wars are the subject of frequent analysis by the International Monetary Fund and they attract a great deal of attention in the financial press.  Currency conflicts cover two different phenomena: one is disagreement about the level of a managed or pegged exchange rate, like the Chinese Yuan; another is the inappropriate level to which floating exchange rates are driven by market forces, as in the case of the Brazilian Real, the Japanese Yen, and the Swiss Franc. A different analysis of how exchange rates come about is required for each case. It reflects the fact that the international monetary system comprises a variety of different ways of determining exchange rates and carrying out monetary policy. Some countries float, some peg, and others are in between. The current international monetary system is not really a {u2018}system{u2019} in the sense that the Gold Standard or the Bretton Woods regime was a system. Instead, it is an ad hoc, patchwork affair. This paper reviews the causes and consequences of these currency conflicts, the way they are likely to develop in the coming years, and some possible solutions.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=103347
103345	3	The European Union and the Palestinian Question/	Vasconcelos, Álvaro,	European public opinion holds that the gravest obstacle to peace in the Middle East is the unwillingness of both sides to compromise, stemming from Israel{u2019}s oppression of Palestinians, Israeli housing settlements on disputed territories and Palestinian suicide attacks. When asked to identify the primary aggressor in the conflict, 43 percent of respondents chose both Israel and the Palestinians, reflecting the chain of retaliations in the conflict. Only 25 percent considered Israel to be the sole aggressor and even less {u2013} 13 percent {u2013} believed that only the Palestinian side was to blame. Although the European public deeply condemns the Palestinian suicide and rocket attacks on Israel, they are equally critical of Tel Aviv{u2019}s response. For example: 46 percent disapprove of the wall built to separate Israel from the West Bank; 53 percent consider the economic blockade of the Gaza Strip to be illegal; and 60 percent condemn the Israeli armed incursion in the area in the winter of 2008{u2013}2009. These results show a growing trend in the opinion of European citizens that Israeli government policies are responsible for the failure of the peace process.  The Arab democratic wave is fundamentally changing the regional context of the Palestinian issue, and gradually ending the American and European quasi-monopoly as external peace mediators. Obviously, in the past a number of Arab initiatives have occurred, but the gap between leaders and Arab public opinion allowed some {u2013} such as Mubarak {u2013} to align them with the American stance at the time. The end of the Mubarak regime has brought Egypt much closer to all Palestinians. It was already clear there was no longer support in Egypt for the stifling closure of Gaza. With the end of authoritarianism, Egypt was quick to move to a position quite similar to that of Turkey, in that it combines a genuine desire for peace with Israel with strong support for the rights of the Palestinians, including the right to statehood, an opinion shared by the majority of the European public.  Whether a one- or a two-state solution looms on the horizon, the question of civil rights for the Palestinians will not go away, nor will the need of all parties in the conflict to comply with international law. Whatever the circumstances, an approach centered on adherence to laws, norms and fundamental rights seems to be the option that will remain at the heart of EU policy for years to come.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=103345
103344	3	Afghanistan: | Challenges of the Transition to Peace/	Jalali, Ali Ahmad.  ,	Sustainable peace in Afghanistan can be achieved only through the establishment of an 2end-state3 that is acceptable to the Afghan people but does not undermine the legitimate security interests of other actors in the region and beyond. This necessitates addressing legitimate national, regional and international concerns emanating from the Afghanistan situation. The key to achieving this goal is an integrated strategy that combines military strategy with political and developmental strategies.  In developing such strategies, Afghan society needs to be mobilized in pursuit of what its population aspires to instead of what a supply-driven assistance program imposes upon it. The success of such a strategy depends on resources, sound Afghan leadership, coordinated international partnership, and {u2013} most importantly {u2013} time. Given local and regional political and security dynamics, the transition process will be multi-dimensional, complex, and nonlinear.  Given the complexities of the regional environment, there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan. Sustainable peace should come through a political settlement; and yet, the conflict can be lost militarily. Without military gains in the field, no elements of a political strategy can succeed: the insurgents will have little incentive to enter meaningful peace talks; the government will be unable to hold contested areas to establish effective local government and win over the population; regional actors will continue to hedge their bets. Furthermore, lack of military progress will give way to doubts in troop-providing nations about the sagacity of the mission.  A successful transition is contingent on progress in reconciliation with, and reintegration of insurgents. Security arrangements for the process need to accompany peace talks. In this context, the military strategy should play a supporting role creating the space for effective prosecution of the political strategy. The gradual drawdown of US forces should be balanced with shifting the security responsibility to Afghan security forces as they progressively become more capable of doing the job. The pace of the drawdown must be 2condition-based.3 A fast-paced drawdown creates a security vacuum and reduces the chances of drawing the insurgents toward a negotiated political settlement.  Finally, there is a need to emphasize the development of good governance and the rule of law, and to address the key grievances that fuel insurgency. In concrete terms, government reform requires a series of short-term and long-term corrective measures, including: improvement in the center{u2013}peripheries relationship; establishing checks and balances on executive power; improving government service-delivery capacity; enforcing the rule of law; and fighting corruption.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=103344
103343	3	Pakistan{u2019}s Security Perspectives /	Ali, Syed Athar,	Pakistan{u2019}s security matrix is beset by multi-dimensional threats which stem from a host of external and internal factors such as economic deprivation, poverty, drug trafficking, natural disasters, and terrorism. Terrorism and extremism have posed particular challenges for Pakistan; the country has played a leading role in the global campaign against terrorism and has consequently paid a very high price. At the same time, the lack of success achieved by coalition forces in their attempts to create stability in Afghanistan has impeded Pakistani efforts to stabilize its western tribal regions. Nevertheless, in spite of all the challenges, Pakistan feels that it has been generally successful in containing the insurgency and confining it to a limited geographical area through a combination of political and military measures.  Pakistan views India as its most important neighbor and seeks a sustained, substantive and result-oriented process of dialogue. Pakistan would like to resolve all outstanding issues with India in a peaceful and just manner. The country attaches great importance to a purposeful, broad-ranging engagement; however, this will require India to play a more positive and accommodating role and respond to Pakistan{u2019}s legitimate security concerns. India will not find Pakistan unwilling to write a new chapter in the two countries{u2019} bilateral relations. Positive manifestations of India{u2019}s peace initiative can only be seen through the implementation of tangible steps, including a reduction in the defense budget and the prevention of an arms race.  The terrorism which prevails today has developed into militancy of dangerous proportions for Pakistan, placing it at the top of the internal security agenda. Terrorism is now a challenge for Pakistan more than any other state. The militants are well equipped, funded, and motivated, and enjoy foreign support. Needless to say, the potential effect of this militancy could be felt both regionally and globally. Therefore, peace and stability in South Asia will remain elusive unless this issue is addressed comprehensively. All stakeholders must remain engaged on a long-term basis if lasting success is to be achieved. Also, a much greater degree of understanding is needed between Pakistan, Afghanistan and coalition forces in order to adopt and apply a common approach on both sides of the Pakistan{u2013}Afghanistan border. Pakistan alone cannot bear the burden of responsibility for a global problem whose genesis is to be found elsewhere.  The international community must show greater resolve in Afghanistan and more patience towards Pakistan, if we are to succeed. Regional countries would also do well to assist Pakistan in these efforts, rather than exploiting this as an opportunity to malign the country, if the scourge of terrorism is to be erased from South Asia.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=103343

103340	3	Essentials of School Education in the United Arab Emirates /		This book is based on the proceedings of the Second Annual Education Conference of the Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research (ECSSR), entitled 2Essentials of School Education in the United Arab Emirates3 held on October 3{u2013}4, 2011. The Second Annual Education Conference tackled the essentials of school education in the UAE through the examination of various issues including the role of national policies and legislation in developing education systems; the relationship between Emirati society and the education process; domestic and international pedagogical philosophies; fundamentals of teacher training and student development; curricula reform; the role of technology in the advancement of education; and fundamentals necessary to ensure standards of educational excellence in the UAE. This Conference came as a continuation of the vision adopted by the ECSSR that seeks to raise the quality of education, examine future developments and identify obstacles that may impede educational progress in the country. In addition to organizing past seminars, panel sessions and lectures that dealt with educational issues and publishing material on the subject, the ECSSR has formed a strategic outlook specifically for education in the UAE, and the Arabian Gulf region in general, and has undertaken the responsibility of tackling all issues and problems related to this topic.  This strategic outlook for education adopted by the ECSSR is inspired by the leadership in the country, which considers advancing education as the engine of national development and seeks to raise the standard of education in the country to be among the five most advanced educational systems in the world. Therefore, the advancement of education, in quantity and quality, has been at the forefront of development in the country in recognition of it being the key to the knowledge economy and guarantees national progress. In addition, the various strategic development plans drafted by the government depend almost completely on the quality of national education in the coming decades.  The sessions of this Conference and the ensuing discussions and comments compiled in this book have highlighted the importance of research and development related to education{u2014}a role that the ECSSR proudly undertakes through its unique events, seminars and lectures attended by some of the best minds in the world of education.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=103340

101137	6	Abu Dhabi : | oil and beyond /	Davidson, Christopher M.	A rising economic power, Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates, is poised to become a major player in the fortunes of both Third and First World countries. Abu Dhabi owns more than 8 percent of the world's oil reserves, has close to one trillion dollars to invest in sovereign wealth funds, and is about to implement a masterful set of economic initiatives that will yield even greater returns.  Abu Dhabi has begun to eclipse its partner city, Dubai, in terms of sheer wealth and cultural and infrastructural development, opening the world's first Ferrari theme park and erecting satellite branches of the Guggenheim and the Louvre. Author of the best-selling Dubai: The Vulnerability of Success and an expert on Gulf politics, Christopher M. Davidson tracks Abu Dhabi's remarkable growth from a modest, eighteenth-century sheikhdom to its present opulent state. He recounts the dramatic efforts made by the emirate's dynastic family to retain their power, detailing the system of "tribal capitalism" they created in order to reconcile old political allegiances with modern engines of growth. Davidson concludes with potential challenges to Abu Dhabi's political and economic success, including a weakening of civil society, invasive media censorship, an ongoing labor crisis, increasing federal unrest, and persistent underperformance in the education sector.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=101137

There had been the gold and spices from nearby India, and the petroleum of today, extracted from its sands or brought from elsewhere, from off the shores of its coasts. It is difficult to imagine that these seven Emirates have a history, as understood in Western canons. Here, the past seems to have been dug away with excavators, drowned in concrete, built over with metropolitan motorways. This does not prevent it from seeming to surge forth at the slightest provocation, at the smallest of solicitations. Proud of what the world acknowledges as his country{u2019}s achievements, the most insolent of Emiratis grows less arrogant when recalling his father{u2019}s fathers. Fathers who, hardly more than four decades ago, were Bedouins, traders, camel drivers, almost all pearl fishers... It is in this way that this modern history was written. Twenty centuries of hard seasonal migration of their livestock, intensive trade, fierce competition, destructive setbacks and creative imagination forged mentalities that have made this desert into one of the richest and most envied places in the world.

97807	6	Globalization and the United Arab Emirates : | the task of economic diversification /	Tilburg, Markus van,	"During the last decade, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) established high profile cities and built modern architectural marvels into the desert sand and the Persian Gulf. Markus van Tilburg analyses the factors behind those profound changes, of which the aforementioned constructions are only one aspect. He is focusing on the Emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Two states with varied geographic pre-conditions, history and efforts to pursue diverse economic strategies in order to escape from resource abundance. The global economic ascendancy of the UAE, within a period of merely 20 years, gives raise to a variety of questions.  The author answers some of these: What were the driving forces and which were the decisive catalysts behind the UAEś steep economic growth? Did geographical factors contribute to this role? Were lessons from previous oil booms successfully applied and did they contribute to actual and future developments? Do strategies used to compensate actual oil income really work, what perspectives do they give, and are they sustainable? Was the globalization process beneficial to the UAEś diversification strategies? How is the globalization process promoting the creation of local markets?"-- Provided by publisher.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=97807
97804	6	The UAE and foreign policy : | foreign aid, identities and interests /	Almezaini, Khalid S,	"This book provides a detailed analysis of the foreign policy and foreign aid strategies of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Exploring the cultural factors that have impacted on the foreign policy behaviour of the UAE and its foreign aid, the author argues that the country's foreign policy and foreign aid is strongly influenced by Islamic teachings and by its Arab culture. The author offers a critical analysis of Arab aid in general through the lens of International Relations theories (mainly Constructivism and Rationalism), as well as an in-depth study of the UAE's foreign aid programme. Using the case studies of Palestine and Pakistan, the focus moves beyond the UAE to show how cultural factors have impacted on the behaviour of the authorities across the wider Arab Middle East."--Provided by publisher.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=97804

It reveals the emergence of the man and the state, documenting with insight the dramatic palace coups in his own country and the neighbouring emirate of Ras al-Khaimah and the struggles for power during the formation of the United Arab Emirates. Revealing fascinating and untold parts of the history of the Gulf state, the author's story is told with humour and passion, including his role in the protests and anti-British sabotage actions following the tripartite aggression against Egypt in 1956, his brief affiliation with the Ba'th party and the subsequent attempt on his life by party zealots in the 1960s, the occasionally baffled British administration attempting to follow the changing balances in power, and the siege of the palace in 1972 in which the former ruler of Sharjah was killed. -- Product Description							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=96328

Dubai boasts not only the world's largest man-made island, but also a extraordinarily varied population, consisting of expatriates from all over the world - India, China, England, the Philippines - Barrett explores the city, leading the reader to discover what lies below the gleaming skyline, not just malls and sport courts, but also mosques and temples, courthouses and speakeasies - making it the first book to look behind the scenes at Dubai as a whole, in terms of life, business and culture."- Publisher.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=96185
96184	6	A diamond in the desert : | behind the scenes in Abu Dhabi, the world's richest city /	Tatchell, Jo.,	Chronicles the author's journey back to Abu Dhabi, her examination of the social and economic changes the city has experienced during the last forty years, and an investigation into her brother's sudden departure from the city. ¦ "Arabia in the 1960s - still a land of desert, nomadic tribes, falcons and gazelles. And Abu Dhabi, perched on the Gulf Coast, was a poor fishing community. Barely forty years on, it is the riches city on earth, with major stakes in Western economies. And if the extraordinary ambitious plans for the capital of the United Arab Emirates succeed, its future impact will be global." "Jo Tatchell's family arrived in Abu Dhabi in 1974 when there were only a few thousand inhabitants. She left as a young adult in the nineties, choosing personal freedom over a life of comfort and ease. But in recent years, as Abu Dhabi has become ever more significant on the world stage, she has returned to get behind the headlines and see how the city is changing for herself." "In this portrait, she shows Abu Dhabi past and present through the eyes of its people - from sheikhs to Indian immigrants, housewives to ex-pats - as well as her own. Tales of traditional Bedu hospitality and of expeditions into the desert mingle with accounts of hair-raising decadence and double standards, as she reveals a society and culture almost derailed by sudden, extreme wealth. And yet, as she discovers, Abu Dhabi is about to change again. Its rulers have a grand vision of a cultural bridge between Islam and the West, which might just transform our world."--BOOK JACKET.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=96184

But besides the official recordings of historical moments, Noor Ali Rashid was also there to capture less formal events, thus providing the material to compose, in this book, amore human, touching and real portrait of Dubai's Ruler.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=95369

95359	3	Arab Sovereign Wealth Funds and their political implications /	Toledo, Hugo,	"The purpose of this paper is to provide a qualitative analysis of the ongoing debate about Arab sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) in international financial markets. The analysis concentrates on three aspects: the mixing of politics and financial returns; the potential of SWFs to serve a world stabilization funds; and the future of energy policy in GCC countries given the expected growth of Arab SWFs. The secrecy and the lack of transparency in the management of some SWFs, especially those of GCC countries, have raised eyebrows of prominent politicians from Europe to North America. Fear of the real intentions of these funds when they make investment decisions is at the core of the debate. In response to such concerns, the IMF is proposing the development of a code of conduct for SWFs{u2014}an idea that has not been well received, especially by some of the Arab SWFs".							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=95359
95358	3	The transformation of war : | the rise of private contractors /	Kinsey, Christopher,	"This paper is divided into four parts: the first simply defines what is meant by war fighting and identifies which military tasks fall under the war-fighting banner or outside it in the case of logistical support. The second part gives a brief account of the role of contractors in support of military operations during the Cold War, which is widely seen as a period in which militaries were self-sufficient. However, the reality was somewhat different since it was during this period that contractors began to take on roles that in the past were deemed the responsibility of the military. What appeared different during the Cold War was that the contracting out of support functions was confined to home bases and had not yet reached the front line. The third part explains why states now feel the need to turn to contractors for support in expeditionary operations, while the final part examines the socio/political, economic and technological forces driving this change. It should also be noted that this paper is concerned mainly with the UK and US militaries, for the simple reason that these forces have gone the furthest in contracting out their logistical support in the operational space."							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=95358

This paper examines the question of a potential Kurdistan through a new lens of analysis that explores not simply the cold, hard struggle for sovereignty, but the softer 2para-diplomatic3 performances acting as the creative energies that market these struggles to the international community."							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=95357

94690	6	City of gold : | Dubai and the dream of capitalism /	Krane, Jim,	Dubai is everything the Arab world isn't--a freewheeling capitalist oasis in the desert--and in this new book, Jim Krane brings us a boots-on-the ground look at this fascinating city, straight from the heart of Dubai itself. Dubai, just a dusty village in the 1960s, has been transformed into the quintessential metropolis of the future through the vision of clever sheiks, British entrepreneurs, American capitalists who longed for a free market Mecca, and a river of investor money that poured in from around the globe. What these people created is a tolerant and cosmopolitan city with luxurious resorts, architectural landmarks, and outposts of America's most prestigious companies and universities. It's at once a magnet for the Middle East's intelligentsia as well as one of the most eco-unfriendly places on the planet. In this compelling new book, Jim Krane charts the history of Dubai from its earliest days, considers the influence of the Maktoum family which has ruled since the early nineteenth century, and looks at the effect of the global economic downturn on a place that many doubt  as a blueprint for a more stable Middle East.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=94690

94607	6	Maritime nation : | United Arab Emirates /		The United Arab Emirates is, in the true sense of the word, a maritime nation. Not only does it possess over 800 kilometres of mainland coastline and a large number of islands in both the Arabian Gulf and the Arabian Sea, it also has a long and proud tradition of sailing. navigation, boat building, pearling, fishing, and marine trading. From as far back as archaeologists have traced Man's existence in the land now known as the UAE, there is strong evidence of local inhabitants' dependence upon the sea. Artefacts in the form of ancient pearls, shell necklaces, pottery decorated with fish motifs and carved pendants depicting early sailing craft (including one with the first known depiction of a lateen sail), form a vital part of this archaeological record, whilst carved fish hooks, net-sinkers, fish bones, piles of sea-shells or mounds of dugong and turtle bones attest to an early fishing industry and to the development of fishing techniques over the centuries. The archaeological record has also yielded uncontrovertible evidence of the UAE's intimate maritime commercial links with ancient civilisations. Indeed in later times, Emirati seafarers were skilled navigators, much sought after for their knowledge on Indian Ocean navigation long before the Portuguese entered the arena. One of the greatest of these, and one whom we know much about because of his extensive writings (an extract of which is quoted above), was Ahmed ibn Majid. Born in Julfar, adjacent to the present day city of Ras al-Khaimah, by the time Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope, Ibn Majid had hung up his navigation instruments and was in the twilight of his life, but his name had spread throughout the Arab World and has lived on to this day as one of the most respected of Arab scientists and writers. Just as famous in song and legend is the UAE's most renowned marine product, the precious pearl. Harvested since early times, pearling continued to be a source of prosperity right up to the twentieth century. Today, the UAE's dependence upon the sea remains multifaceted: a source of food, the raw material for desalination plants that provide most of the country's drinking and industrial water, a vital transportation route linking it with other countries, a site for many of its oil and gas wells, and a growing attraction for leisure tourists and sporting enthusiasts. This short booklet is a brief reminder of this fascinating aspect of the UAE's heritage and a reminder of the deep love and respect which the people of the UAE have for the sea.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=94607

Published to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the UAE and updated immediately after Sheikh Zayed passed away in November 2004, this book contains rare historical photographs of events in the Federation's past, as well as stunning portraits of Sheikh Zayed. Images that highlight his dual roles as Ruler of Abu Dhabi and President of the UAE are accompanied by pictures of a less formal, more intimate nature, showing Sheikh Zayed as a family man and father, both to his own family and to the nation. As the only official photographer to Sheikh Zayed and the Presidential Court for more than four decades, Noor Ali Rashid made the most of the unique opportunities afforded him since Sheikh Zayed first came to power in 1966, and faithfully captured the enormous impact of his dynamic rule. It is not surprising therefore that this book has been accomplished academic text by no less an institution than the Zayed University.

The issue of the three occupied UAE islands  the Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa  deserves particular attention because it threatens to undermine regional security and has potential global implications. Given the commanding position of the islands over the major shipping lanes of the Arabian Gulf and their strategic location in the vicinity of important offshore oilfields, the continuing Iranian occupation of these key islands is undoubtedly a matter of international   concern. By documenting the historical record and examining the relevant international precedents, this comprehensive study highlights and reinforces the legal and sovereign rights of the United Arab Emirates over the three islands. The study is supported by extensive and meticulous research based on both primary and secondary sources: declassified British and US archival records and original historical documents, relevant legal studies, memoirs of important personalities, interviews with key players and analyses by political commentators.   In keeping with the UAE{u2019}s policy of seeking a just and peaceful resolution to this dispute, this book aims to promote a better understanding of its complexities by offering fresh insight on the historical, political, legal, regional and international dimensions of the islands issue for the benefit of policy makers, academics, researchers and decision makers concerned with the future security and stability of the Gulf region.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=87268

Much, tough, remains to be discovered. Scientific interest in the country's past has also developed over the past few years to go far beyond the origins of human settlement in the Emirates and to delve into geological and palaeontological issues. Here too, there have been important discoveries, particularly from the Late Miocene period, 6-8 million years ago. The fossils of land and freshwater animals from that period are now better known from the UAE than from anywhere else in the Middle East. This collection of papers, first presented at a Symposium organised by the Zayed Center for Heritage and History in Al Ain in April 2003, reports on some of the latest investigations into the UAE's past, from the Late Miocene period until the middle of the 20th Century, prior to the commencement of development that followed upon the discovery of oil. They show that the rapid pace of discovery continues, with major new finds being made. The Symposium has, in subsequent years, become an annual event, permitting those working on palaeontology and archaeology in the country to come together at the end of each winter field season to exchange information about their work, and to promote a greater knowledge of it within the country".							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=86104

85105	6	Al Ain /	Barrault, Michèle	The garden city of Al Ain has a history of over 7,000 years. As a centre of habitation and a resting place for caravanserai, it is well known to travelers and to people of the region. Its greenness, tranquility, and warm hospitality soothed those who made often long journeys in a very harsh and demanding environment. As an oases city, Al Ain had much to offer the traditional and now, modern-day traveler. The photographs and text in this book illustrate the rich tradition, culture and enduring values of its people. The patronage and personal interest in the city and the Eastern Region by His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates has embellished its development. His Highness Sheikh Zayed's insistence on conserving and encouraging cultural values, the importance of heritage and environ-mental care together with changes to enhance the quality of life and career opportunities for people, have ensured that development has been sensitive and appropriate to the intrinsic values of Al Ain. The time is now opportune to share these traditions, values and warm hospitality. Modern travelers may have little opportunity to visit and enjoy a traditional location which despite having available many facilities, services and attractions of international standard, still retains a distinctiveness which will provide a different experience.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=85105

Davidson first provides a detailed  historical background, tracing the recent history of the lower Gulf region, the British  involvement in the area, and the establishment of the federation of emirates.  He then turns his  attention to the UAE's seemingly anachronistic political structure and its socioeconomic  development.  His astute analysis highlights the UAE's achievements as well as the problems  that have persistently undermined its development objectives.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=81730

Published to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the UAE, this book contains rare historical photographs of events in the Federation's past, as well as stunning portraits of Sheikh Zayed. Images that highlight his dual roles as Ruler of Abu Dhabi and President of the UAE are accompanied by pictures of a less formal, more intimate nature, showing Sheikh Zayed as a family man and father, both to his own family and to the nation. As the only official photographer to Sheikh Zayed for more than four decades, Noor Ali Rashid has made the most of the unique opportunities afforded him since Sheikh Zayed first came to power in 1966, and has faithfully captured the enormous impact of his dynamic rule. From the early years to the new millennium, at home and abroad, Noor Ali Rashid shares these images with us in one magnificent volume.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=77599

75234	6	Now and then Sharjah /	Nowell, John J,	Sharjah's transformation, in the latter half of the twentieth century, has been dramatic. The discover of oil helped rescue an economy suffering from the sudden and unexpected demise of the pearling industry. With wise investment of the new revenue Sharjah has rapidly developed into a modern, commercial city and a lively, bustling Emirate. No longer recognizable as the small, scattered, fishing and trading villages it once was, but with the same strong Islamic values and cultural heritages, Sharjah faces the future with confidence. "Now & Then - Sharjah" provides a fascinating insight into an Emirate in continuous transition, a beautiful and historical photographic record and an inspiration for photographers in the years to come.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=75234

69464	6	A prehistoric mound in the Emirate of Umm al-Qaiwain, UAE : | excavations at Tell Abraq in 1989 /	Potts, Daniel T,	In 1989 a new program of excavations was begun at Tell Abraq, a large prehistoric mound in the emirate of Umm al-Qaiwain, U.A.E. One of the few deeply stratified sites in southeastern Arabia, Tell Abraq provides evidence of an uninterrupted occupation sequence running from the early third to the  middle of the first millennium B.C. The richness of the finds made during the first season is amply illustrated in this report. The site's links to the Indus Valley, Iran, Bahrain, and Mesopotamia  are clearly indicated by the material recovered. For the first time in southeast Arabian archaeology it is possible to follow the evolution of the local material culture from the Umm an-Nar period (2500-2000 B.C.), through the Wadi Suq period (2000-1300 B.C.), and on through the Iron Age (1300-300 B.C.) at one single site. The results of the first season have convincingly identified Tell Abraq as one of the most important prehistoric sites in eastern Arabia.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=69464

65303	6	Faces of the  Emirates : | an Arabian album : a collection of mid-20th century photographs /	Codrai, Ronald,	This Arabian Album is Ronald Codrai's personal record of the people of the Emirates at the middle of the last century, a brief glimpse at a small section of history which he was privileged to witness. Codrai would have been delighted that this book - like all his other works - will be enjoyed by those living and working in the part of the world portrayed in his photographs. This in itself symbolises the vast changes that have occurred since those days when there were no newspapers, telephones, faxes, television or e-mail; when typewriters were as few as motor vehicles and the nearest printing press was in Bombay. Commenting on his love for photography, Ronald Codrai remarked: "Photography has always been my hobby, and during my stay and travels in south-eastern Arabia I took numerous photographs. Many were the happy evenings I spent processing them in an improvised darkroom in our home, then washing the results in the sea the next day as we swam." The pictures in this book have been reproduced from those original black-and-white negatives and colour transparencies which were very rare at the time. All of the photographs featured are available as enlarged prints suitable for display.

65229	6	Archaeological surveys in Sharjah Emirate (U.A.E.) : | first  report (1984) /	Boucharlat, Remy.	It is because of the keen interest shown by H.H. Shaikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammad Al Qassimi, the Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, that the cultural heritage started to be considered as one of the main targets of the cultural planning. Hence archaeology came to be one of the priorities of the Department of Culture and Information of Sharjah Government. In 1984 the Sharjah Government invited a 7- member team of French archaeologist to Sharjah. This group, consisted of experts from (C.N.R.S. Maison de l'Orient) and Lyon University, visited the Sharjah Emirate under the patronage of the French Ministry of Foreign relations. Through a fruitful collaboration with a national team of UAE, they succeeded in making a general survey in Sharjah and marked some important archaeological map of the Emirate and to safeguard all areas expected to be excavated later. This first report of joint survey of the year 1984 on Sharjah archaeology reviews an excellent pioneering work done in less than two weeks time making a new landmark in rediscovering the cultural heritage and ancient civilization of the Emirates. This bilingual report aims to enlighten the nationals as well as the foreigners interested in U.A.E's cultural heritage in general and archaeology in particular.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=65229
65228	6	Archaeological surveys in Sharjah Emirate (U.A.E.) : | fourth report (1988) /	Bernard, Vincent.	The fourth season of survey and archaeological excavation by the Joint Archaeological Expedition in the Sharjah Emirate (Department of Archaeology and Museum Sharjah and French Archaeological Mission in Sharjah) took place from 21 January until 7 april 1988. This program of cooperation started in 84, aims to establish archaeological maps of the Sharjah Emirate, to prospect more accurately some areas, and to dig archaeological sites. In agreement with the Department of Culture, the 88 program dealt with two operations the end of the survey of the western coast of Sharjah and the continuity of the digging in Mleiha. Upon the demand of the Department of Archaeology, the French team also took care of the study of the material from a major site, dug by the department of Archaeology in the Al-Madam area. This operation indicates our will to participate in the knowledge of the past of Sharjah and t take part in the preservation of its Heritage. This project is placed under the patronage pf H.H. Shaikh Sultan bin Mohammad al Qassimi who has at heart to keep himself well informed of the results. It benefits from the total support of H.H. Ahmed bin Mohammad al Qassimi, who regularly shows his interest and gives it all the neces-sary help towards it realisation. May we express our gratitude to these high Authorities, and also to other people responsible of the Department of Culture. As regards Sharjah, the program is directed by Director of the Directorate of Archaeology, at the Department of Culture. He is assisted by Mr. Mustafa Tawfiq al-Haseem, who efficiently ensures the organisation of field work, and is for us a colleague and a friend. Several members of the Department of Culture have often been asked to contribute to ensure the success of the program. May we thank them here. In France, this program is an act of cooperation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It isor-ganised and financed by the Secretary of Social and Human Sciences and by the Maison de l'Orient (CNRS/Universite Lumiere-Lyon 2); it also benefits from the cooperation of researchers of the labs from the CNRS in Paris and Valbonne, and University Claude Bernard-Lyon 1, Lumiere-Lyon 2 and Center de Researches Geophysiques, Garchy. in the U.A.E. the French Ambassy from Abu Dhabi brought us all the necessary help, and we would like to express our gratitude to the French Ambassador for the interest he showed in our work, and Mr. C. Jouret, Cultural Attache for his help and understanding. It is a pleasant duty to thank other persons and institutions who have made possible the suc-cess of the 88 campaign. In Sharjah, especially the Municipality of Sharjah and Dr. Ibrahim Kahkah, Director of the Survey Department who, as in previous years, was quite often asked for help in pro-viding the undispensable topographical equipment, maps and all useful information for the survey. the efficient collaboration between the Municipality of Sharjah and the Joint Archaeological Expedition was never at fault. We asked the al-Qassimi Hospital for the study of bronze objects, whose X-ray analysis revealed a great deal of interest. Lastly, we are grateful to the French Company.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=65228
65227	6	Archaeological surveys in Sharjah Emirate (U.A.E.) : | third report (1986)\	Boucharlat, Remy	The joint sharjah -French expedition resulted in gaining some very important and valuable information about the past. From objects found till 1986 from the three sites excavated so far, it was possible to draw a panorama of these areas dating back from neolithic period, through different civilizations like 1st millennium and Hellenistic period. It is proved that keen interest and tireless effort will pay off. This 3rd report, on the excellent excavation works carried out in 1986, by a 14-member team of highly experienced French archaeologists and specialists, in various sites of Sharjah Emirate, brings up fresh evidence on historic periods back to the Modern Stone Age (location of Al-Qssimia in Sharjah and Al-Fayah mountain in Central Region of the Emirate). We can now talk about the people of those times, their life style, their culture and customs, their neighbouring regions etc. etc. The discovery of Melaiha settlement (Hellenistic period) provides us with a great deal of information about the inhabitants of that period, their way of life, their crafts, their trade relations with the nearby region like "Al-Faw" of Saudi Arabia and the far away countries like Greece. Taking into consideration the successful collaboration with the French team, the Sharjah Government made negotiations with the representatives of French archaeological expedition group and the French Embassy to have an agreement to plan and re-organize archaeological excavation in the Emirate for future.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=65227
65226	6	Archaeological surveys and excavations in the Sharjah Emirate, 1993 and 1994 : | a eight interim report /		This report concerns the 1993 and 1994 work seasons of the joint archaeological mission in Sharjah under the directorship of Dr. M.Mouton, carried out between mid-January and the beginning of March 1993, and between the end of January and the end of the April 1994, on the site of Mleiha and in the al-Madam area. The mission was placed under the patronage of H.H.Dr. Shaikh Sultan bin Mohammad al-Qassimi, Member of the Supreme Council, Ruler of Sharjah. The mission was supported at Sharjah by the Directorate of Antiquities and Heritage, (Department of Culture and Information) directed by Mr. Nassir H. Al Abdooli, assisted in 1993 by Mr. Mustafa Tawfiq al-Hazeem, who left the department in 1994, to our great regret. On the French side the mission is financed by the Commission des Fouilles, Ministere des Affaires Etrangeres, and the CNRS (URA 913, Maison de l'Orient, Lyon, and CRA, Valbonne). Our activities were assisted greatly by the French Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the French Consulate at Dubai, as well as by Mr. J.De Vaulx, Representative at Abu Dhabi TOTAL -Compagine Francaise des Petroles, by Mr. J.C. Gagnant (Subtec Co.), and ADCO (who offered satellite photographs) in Sharjah. To all these authorities and persons, the mission expresses its thanks. In 1993 the team consisted to Miss A. Benoist (archaeologist), Miss. K. Bonner (archaeolo-gist), Dr. R. Dalongeville (geomorphologist), Miss. M. Dohet (draftswoman), Mr. P. Garczynski (archi-tect), Mr. K. Mokaddem (archaeologist). In 1994, the team consisted to Miss. A. Benoist (archaeologist), Miss. K. Bonner (archaeolo-gist), Dr. O. Callot (numismatist), Mr. D. Connolly (draftsman), Dr. R. Dalongeville (geomorphologist), Miss M. Mashkour (zoologist), Dr. A. Montigny (ethnologist), Mr. S. Orzechowski (archaeologist), Mr. Ph. Oysellet (archaeologist), Dr. A. Ploquin (geologist) Mr. Z. Sekraoui (archaeologist), Miss T. Tortosa (archaeologist). To these participants in the field must be added our specialist colleagues who study the data in France, Dr. B. Briant (geologist), Dr. Y. Calvet (archaeologist), J. Connan (bitumen study), Dr. J. Evin (radiocarbon), Miss M. Millet (lithic industry), Dr. A.Prieur (malacologist), Dr. Ch. Robin (South Arabic inscriptions), Dr. J. Teixidor (Aramaic inscriptions) and in Spain, Prof. E. Baron (palaeob-otanist), Prof. M Garcia Anton and Dr. H. Sains Oller (palynologists). The work carried out concerned the site of Mleiha and the region of al-Madam situated 12 kilometers farther south, along the western foothills of the Oman mountains. Exploratory trenches dug at Mleiha in 1992 revealed at fortified building of which the exca-vation justified the continuation of work as well as a new field program. This program has two main orientations: the study of large buildings in relation of power; the excavation of the fort and its surroundings con-tributes to an understanding of a building of very large dimensions excavated in 1974 by the Iraqi archaeological mission which interpreted it as a palace; ancient metallurgy; it is at Mleiha that the oldest evidence of iron metallurgy in this part of Arabia was found; several areas related to the working of copper and iron have been located, offering the possibility of studying ancient techniques and perhaps of understanding the phenomenon of the adoption of iron metallurgy. In addition, field work and sampling were carried out to complete the study of the palaeo environment of the ancient site. At al-Madam, systematic surveying was completed in 1993 and excavations began in 1994. in collaboration with a team from the Department of Ancient History of the Autonomous University of Madrid directed by Prof. J. Cordoba. The work program carried out in the plain of al-Madam covers occupation during the Iron Age. Two research themes govern the field work: refine the internal chronology of this period (pottery sequence and chronology established at Rumeilah by R. Boucharlat and P. Lombard) through the new stratigraphic excavations in the habitation sectors of al-Madam; define the final occupation phase of the Iron Age villages to study the transition to the Late Pre Islamic Period and the changes related to the development of the neighboring site of Mleiha. At the same time, the different specialists of the French Archaeological Mission are collaborating with the Directorate of Antiquities and Heritage of Sharjah and particularly with the Museum of  Sharjah, as scientific counselors.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=65226

64597	6	The United Arab Emirates handbook 1998 /		When people think of Arabia and the UAE, almost invariably preconceptions based upon out-of-date or ill-informed ideas come to mind, the most common being that the country has little to offer but oil and sand. This small Handbook, although it cannot provide information on all aspects of the UAE, will, hopefully, assist in dispelling these predictable misconceptions, at the same time offering a glimpse of the true nature of this intriguing country, thereby stimulating further exploration and discovery.  Although the Emirates were only united into a single federal state as recently as 1971, their story goes back long before recorded history, to times when much of today's landmass was beneath the sea, and when southern Arabia was joined with Africa, forming part of a megacontinent known as Gondwana. Evidence for this phase lies in the UAE's rocks and indeed in the underground reservoirs of oil and gas which have so beneficially supported the country's current renaissance. Entrapped within these rocks are fossils that tell their own tales of ancient rivers, hippopotamus, crocodiles and an environment more like that of tropical Africa than the dry deserts of Arabia. Man's presence on this part of the Arabian peninsula can be traced to at least the Late Stone Age, but much evidence must have been lost by the post-glacial rise in sea-level. Moving forward in time the archaeological record is remarkably complete, revealing the activities of ancient settlers, fishermen, traders on land and sea and of pre-Islamic Christian communities living on remote islands. Archaeological evidence from the Islamic Period, with its colourful history and its cultural consolidation, is also abundant. The UAE landscape, both natural and man-made, is indeed a palimpsest and it is only if we peel back the layers that we can reveal the treasures that lie hidden beneath the veneer of modernity. This task has been made easier by a number of excellent and imaginatively constructed museums and interpretative centres where one can see, hear and even feel the Emirates of old. These projects are, however, very much a part of the modern UAE, combining entertainment with knowledge, and placing a unique value on culture and heritage. And so to the present era, to a country whose growth rate has astounded even the architects of its development; to a land where whole cities contain few buildings more than ten years old and where skylines continue to be dominated by yellow crane gantries. To a place whose older generation can recall times of great hardship and where the prime means of transport was on foot, or by camel or dhow. To a people who braved the depths of the Arabian Gulf to dive for pearls and whose knowledge of the reefs later brought oil-men, and with them Jacques Cousteau and his modern diving team, to survey amidst the pearl-beds for oil. To a country where the techniques of sea-bed oil drilling were pioneered and one that now ranks among the top oil and gas producers, worldwide. But most of all to a country that has used its oil wealth with remarkable vision and foresight, improving the lives of all its people, creating an infrastructure that supports a growing list of non-oil industries and activities. And to a land where the traditions of Arabia have not been forgotten and where the guiding principles of Islam are deeply respected.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=64597

The day-long gathering initiated a unique dialogue between Emirati and American analysts and officials. What distinguishes these academic studies is that they present analyses of the UAE's sociopolitical institutions, economy and foreign-policy initiatives from a variety of both Emirati and American perspectives. This, in and of itself, is a new endeavor.  Also included here is an essay by Shaykh Sultan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE Deputy Prime Minister who offers his own unique viewpoint on regional matters. This ranking member of the ruling family provides a glimpse into the federation's current perceptions of Gulf security and how it builds on the foundation wisely laid by his father, Shaykh Zayed.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=59007

The new country has flourished since then, an achievement that is a tribute to the leader-ship and wisdom of Shaikh Zayed, head of state and ruler of Abu Dhabi, and Shaikh Rashid al-Maktoum, vice-president and ruler of Dubai until his death in 1990. Without these two men, the UAE would not be what it is today. The UAE Practical & Business Guide is designed to meet the needs of people visiting and working in the UAE, with a special emphasis on the needs of those carrying out business in the federation. Since the first edition was published in 1982, the guide has become an essential companion for anyone working or living in the UAE. This completely revised fifth edition will provide directions for the exciting times ahead. The UAE is now firmly established as one of the Middle East's most dynamic countries. Abu Dhabi, Dubai and the cities of the northern emirates are models of what successful planning and vibrant enterprise can achieve. New industries in services and manufacturing have flourished thanks to a combination of the UAE's abundant wealth in natural resources, the genius of its business community and the wisdom of the federation's government and rulers. The quality of life and the opportunities for business the country now provides is unparalleled, perhaps among emerging economies anywhere in the globe. Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) is proud to publish this guide to the UAE. It is the latest in a series designed to provide a window to the Middle East's fascinating diversity. One of MEED's goals is to broaden and improve these guides in the years to come. In this, we will need your help. So please enjoy this account of the UAE and keep us informed of your own perspectives on this busy gateway to the Gulf.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=58942

58469	6	Les Emirats Arabes Unis : | quinze ans de progres 1971-1986 /		Le 2 Décembre 1986, les EAU ainsi que les septs Etats qui les composent, Abou Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras El Khaïma, Fujairah, Ajman et Oum El Quaiwan, fêteront le quinzième anniversaire de leur indépendance obtenue en 1971. Cet anniversaire est l'occasion heureuse qui nous permettra de méditer sur les résultats obtenus durant ces quinze années. Cette année célébrera aussi deux anniversaires importants. Pendant le mois de Novembre, Abou Dhabi sera le pays qui accueillera la conférence au sommet des six membres du Conseil de Coopération du Golfe Arabe, CCG, qui lui aussi fêtera son cinquième anniversaire. En effet, cet organe de coopération a été fondé il y a cinq ans, en Mai 1981, à Abou Dhabi, seul pays du monde arabe à avoir réussi son expérience de fédération. Le deuxième anniversaire a eu lieu le 6 Août, dâte à laquelle l'émirat d'Abou Dhabi a fêté le 20 ème anniversaire de l'accession de son Altesse Cheikh Zayed Bin Soltane al Nahyan Président aujourd'hui des EAU au pouvoir il y a vingt ans. Pendant les vingt années de règne de Cheikh Zayed sur Abou Dhabi, les quinze années des EAU en tant qu'Etat indépendant, et les cinq années depuis la création du CCG, le pays ainsi que la région dans son ensemble, ont assisté a des changements spéctaculaires dont l'impact est encore ressenti aujourd'hui. D'un coin perdu vivant dans la misère durant l'occupation britanique pendant un siècle et demi, et qui ne connût pour ainsi dire aucun développement, l'Etat des EAU est apparu comme l'un des pays du monde qui se développe le plus rapidement et qui en même temps est l'un des rares pays qui s'est engagé dans la voie d'une plus grande coopération régionale, dans la réalisation d'une distribution plus équitable des ressources et dans un meilleur niveau de vie pour l'humanité dans son ensemble. Durant les quelques années précedentes, les EAU comme c'est le cas des membres du CCG et de l'OPEP ont vu leur économie et la destiné des générations futures sérieusement affectés par les conditions défavorables du marché pétrolier international. Ces conditions ont amené cette année une chute des prix de pétrole à tel point que le prix actuel d'un baril est inférieur à celui de la période précédant le boom des prix de 1973. Malgré ces conditions, toute personne visitant les EAU sera amenée à remarquer que le progrè continue. Cela ne touche pas seulement les secteurs essentiels mais aussi des secteurs moins spéctaculaires tels que la création du service social pour tous les résidents, ou le développement des routes, des ports, des aéroports et de l'industrie mais aussi d'autres secteurs qui promouvent la qualité de la vie, tels que l'amélioration de l'environnement et la construction de centres d'attraction. Cependant, nous pouvons dire que l'Etat des EAU a eu de la chance. Premièrement, il a eu le bonheur d'avoir des ressources pétrolières importantes lui ayant permis de réaliser son programme de développement. Mais aussi, il a eu la félicité d'avoir eu de grands guides depuis l'indépendance. Le Président Cheikh Zayed et son frère, tous deux membres du Conseil Suprême, Chefs des six autres émirats, ont œuvré ensembles durant ces quinze années pour s'assurer que les aspirations du peuple pour le développement soient réalisés. Les résultats de leurs efforts sont palpables aujourd'hui, aussi bien dans les centres urbains que dans les montagnes ou dans le desert. Ils ont aussi réussi à introduire le pays dans la haute sphère internationale où sa position a été consacrée par son éléction pour deux ans en tant que membre non permanent du Conseil de Sécurité de l'ONU, position suprême dans l'organe international, qui puisse être réalisée par un pays autre que les cinq grandes puissances. Pour célébrer les anniversaires de 1986 que nous avons déjà évoqué, nous avons le plaisir d'introduire cet annuaire. Ce ne sera pas un guide exhaustif, cela demandera beaucoup plus de temps et de place; Cependant cet annuaire se propose d'offrir au lecteur une véritable introduction de notre Etat des EAU, de sa culture, de son histoire, des ses monuments et des ses réalisations. Nous souhaitons que le lecteur puisse à travers ce texte et les images incluses, comprendre le progrès déjà réalisé dans notre pays, mais aussi et surtout sentir la confiance de nos citoyens dans l'avenir.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=58469

58429	6	United Arab Emirates /		The United Arab Emirates was established in December 1971. Since then, it has attracted international attention, at first because of its extensive oil reserves, and its strategic location at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf, but now thanks to its unparalleled programme of economic and social development. Over the course of the last quarter of a century, benefiting both from stable and wise leadership, and from an enviable social stability, the country has witnessed the creation of a classic modern welfare state. Education, health care and social services have been extended to all its citizens, with men, women and children being furnished with the necessary opportunities to play their full roles in society from cradle to grave. A federation of seven emirates formerly known as the Trucial States, the UAE occupies a total area of 83,600 square kilometres in the east of the Arabian peninsula, sharing with the neighbouring Sultanate of Oman the area now becoming known as the 'Horn of Arabia.' Its constituent parts are Abu Dhabi, the largest, which has the bulk of the oil reserves and covers around 80 per cent of the land area, Dubai, the commercial centre, Sharjah, and four smaller emirates, in order of size, Ras al Khaimah, Fujairah, Umm al Qaiwain and Ajman. The main cities or towns of each emirate, which carry the same name, are all on the southern shores of the Arabian Gulf, apart from Fujairah, which occupies a short coastal strip on the Gulf of Oman, outside the Strait of Hormuz. The country is a founder member of the Arab Gulf Co-operation Council, created at a summit conference of the six member states held in Abu Dhabi in May 1981, and is also a member of the League of Arab States and the Islamic Conference Organisation as well as of the United Nations and most of its affiliate bodies.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=58429

He grew up in the ruler's palace, barefoot like his friends, who are all now senior figures in the United Arab Emirates. This is a vivid eye-witness account of the total transformation (within only 30 years) of a Bedouin society into a country with the world's highest per capita income. Al-Fahim speaks with great frankness about his own life and provides remarkable insights into the workings of the business community and the ruling elite with the UAE.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=54010

53674	6	Thesiger's return /	Clark , Peter,	Wilfred Thesiger, explorer, legend and enigma, spent the most memorable years of his life in the deserts and oases of southern Arabia, accompanied by the people he admired more than any other—the Bedu. But he left in 1950, disheartened and with a grim foreboding of the events which would change the area and the lives of the people for ever His brief return in 1977 was not a happy experience, and he withdrew to his refuge in a remote corner of Kenya. And yet, on a cool February night in 1990, the flight carrying Wilfred Thesiger back to Arabia touched down at Abu Dhabi international airport. It was the first-ever exhibition of his photographs, held in Abu Dhabi, that had enticed him back, to be followed by another visit twenty months later for the launch of Arabian Sands in Arabic. Illustrated by many of Thesiger's own photographs, some being published for the first time, Thesiger's Return sets the moving events of his 'homecoming' against the backdrop of his extraordinary life.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=53674

52998	6	The Emirates : | Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, Fujairah, Umm Al Qaiwain, Ajman /	Rogers, Hélène.,	The United Arab Emirates is a thriving federation of seven Emirates, forming a crescent along the southern coast of the Arabian Gulf. Since 1971, when the newly independent Emirates joined together, the wise investment of oil revenues under the guidance of Ruler Sheikh Zayed has built the UAE into a prosperous commercial centre. Ambitious projects such as greening the desert, building airports and the founding of Al Ain University exemplify the long-term thinking of the Emirates' government, and have raised the international profile of this state. Every year increasing numbers of visitors enjoy the pleasures of the sandy beaches, the thrilling sports and bustling city life. In this book Helene Rogers has captured the marvels of the Emirates, both natural - the mountains, deserts and coasts - and man-made - from Iron Age forts to high-tech skyscrapers. This unique book will provide a memorable record to be treasured by visitors to the UAE and a tribute in honour of 1996's celebration of twenty-five years of independence and prosperity.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=52998

52557	6	The United Arab Emirates : | unity in fragmentation /	Khalifa, Ali Mohammed,	This first comprehensive book on the United Arab Emirates discusses the background, emergence, and development of the UAE as an integrative venture. Dr. Khalifa asserts that the UAE came into existence because pertinent political elites perceived that the emirates as individual entities were unable to assume the responsibilities of statehood in a highly complicated world, weakened as they were by over a century of dependence on a foreign power. He concludes that the UAE as a federation of ministates will hold together as long as major regional powers judge such an amalgamation to be in their respective national interests or, at least, not incompatible with those interests. Ali Mohammed Khalifa, an administrative officer in the Department of Foreign Procurement, Ministry of Defense and Aviation, Saudi Arabia, received his Ph.D. in political science from the University of California at Santa Barbara. He has been a visiting lecturer at the Military Academy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=52557

48591	6	The United Arab Emirates /	Nayeem, Muhammed Abdul,	This unique work presents for the first time an up-to-date comprehensive study of the United Arab Emirates' earliest civilization. It synthesizes a wide spectrum of data brought to light by the archaeological surveys and excavations conducted during the past decades by several teams from about ten countries and includes both published and unpublished material collected from different countries. Profusely illustrated, the book, an out-come of several years' research by Dr. Nayeem, is designed equally for the specialist and for the general reader interested in the human achievement through the Ages in Arabia in general and the Emirates in particular, within convenient compass. This volume offers the most concise account of all the aspects, as evident from the table of contents, relevant to prehistory and protohistory of the seven Emirates substantiated by very intersting rare photographs. In this highly readable book immense volume of data has been condensed lucidly and it is splendid attempt by Dr. Nayeem of a large and growing subject. The book includes details of most recent archaeological discoveries made until Feb. 1994. Hopefully, this important contribution will remain an invaluable reference for many years to come. This is a book of remarkable distinction, which will become indispensable as a work of reference for any serious student.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=48591

45037	6	The UAE : | formative years, 1965-75 /	Shukla, Ramesh,	The coastal sheikhdoms that joined together to form the United Arab Emirates on December 2, 1971 were sovereign states along the Arabian coast between Qatar and Oman. Britain, with whom the states of he lower Gulf had long been under treaty obligation, had announced in 1968 that it would withdraw from the area in 1971, leaving the sheikhdoms the seemingly impossible task of forming a viable federation within jus three years. At a time when few photographers understood or appreciated the value of recording the changes occurring in UAE society, Ramesh Shukla was amassing a huge number of images showing every aspect of life in the emirates - from the development of a modern infrastructure in the fast-expanding cities to the unchanged traditional life of the smaller emirates. The UAE - Formative Years, 1965-75 is a selection of 130 black and white photographs spanning what are arguably the most important years in the history of the UAE - those immediately preceding and following nationhood. They present a truly unique visual record of a country and a way of life in the throes of dramatic and far-reaching change.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=45037
43784	6	Green grows the oil /	St. Albans, Suzanne Marie Adele Beauclerk,	Abu Dhabi has the highest income per capita in the world and together with neighbouring countries on the Arabian Gulf forms the United Arab Emirates. The discovery of 'black gold' has meant that Abu Dhabi has leapt forward into the twentieth century and has created a situation whereby the dignity, integrity and strong family ties of the old life exist alongside the technological advances and pressures of the modern world. This book explains how the people of Abu Dhabi and its neighbours have adapted to the changes caused by the massive influx of wealth in the last few years.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=43784

40832	6	The United Arab Emirates : | a modern history /	Abdullah, Muhammad Morsy,	The British withdrawal from the Gulf in 1971 brought to an end the British Imperial era in the history of the Trucial States and marked the birth of the United Arab Emirates. This book, first published in 1978, establishes the political, social, economic and cultural heritage of the UAE and explains the formative issues in the development of the new state. From 1892 to 1971 the history of the Gulf was determined by the British presence. Initially the region was regarded by the British as no more than a part of the strategic defence of India, but by 1945 oil and international air communication had given the region a new strategic importance. This volume examines both the early India Office policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of the region and the circumstances after 1947 which prompted the Foreign Office to interfere in certain internal issues. The second half of the book seeks to explain the development of Arab nationalism, the growth of Iranian activities and the relations of the Trucial States with their Western neighbours, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The last chapter provides an historical explanation for the present interstate boundaries and political geography of the region.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=40832

38797	6	The foreign policy of the United Arab Emirates /	Alkim, Hassan Hamdan al-,	Foreign Policy has been crucial to the UAE, ever since its birth in 1971 following Britain’s decision to withdraw from the Gulf. How is the federation’s foreign policy formulated? What are the internal and external pressures which shape it? How can a small Gulf state survive in the modern world? Dr Hassan Hamdan al-Alkim, himself a UAE national, has not only studied the Emirates’ policy-making process in depth. He has also interviewed some of those closely involved in it. His detailed and fully documented study outlines the origins of the UAE and describes the evolution of its policies towards its neighbours, the wider Arab world, and the big powers. Three illuminating case-studies examine relations with Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the UAE’s attitude towards the Palestine question.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=38797
38796	3	The Yemeni War of 1994 : | causes and consequences /		Andrew Wheatcroft in this powerful study argues that the founding father of modern Bahrain was its ruler from 1942 to 1961, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifa. Analysing a wealth of new evidence, he suggests that Shaikh Salman should now be considered one of the pioneers of the modern Middle East. He rejects the accepted historiography, based on a partial reading of the evidence, that credits others with the creation of Bahrain's structure of social welfare.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=38796
13464	6	The three islands : | mapping the UAE-Iran dispute /	Al Nahyan, Khalid S. Z.	For over forty years, the dispute over the three islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb has been a sore in relations between the United Arab Emirates and Iran. Initially occupied by Iran in 1971 during the time of the Shah and the formation of the UAE, the islands are a useful study of a seemingly intractable territorial dispute between a small set of city states and a regional hegemon.  ¦ For the UAE, careful management of the dispute is crucial to neither exasperate conditions and provoke Iran into a more forceful response, possibly targeted at the UAE mainland, nor to give Iran leave to argue that the UAE has dropped its {u2018}misunderstood{u2019} claims to the islands. Long-term management rather than short- term resolution appears to be the best course of action.   For Iran, the dispute is a matter of Emirati misunderstanding. Iran needs little more than for the status quo with the UAE to continue, leaving it free to concentrate on its myriad of other concerns. Yet as the security situation in the Middle East has convulsed in recent years, and international focus has turned more harshly on Iran, an emboldened UAE could, in theory, take advantage of such change to press its point.   In The Three Islands, Khalid S Z Al Nahyan considers the historical roots of the crisis and suggests what possibilities exist for its ultimate resolution - to the benefit of both the UAE and Iran.							https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=13464
