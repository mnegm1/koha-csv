285593;"Public management reform in the Gulf Cooperation Council and beyond / ";"Biygautane, Mhamed,";"""This book offers an understanding of the current state of public management in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, highlighting the region's institutional and human capital constraints. Drawing on case studies from GCC states and beyond, the text provides a policy-oriented analysis of these challenges and a set of recommendations on how to address them. Public Management Reform in the Gulf Cooperation Council and Beyond utilizes several theoretical frameworks to explore three themes: first, how the quality of government and efficiency of its bureaucratic machinery can offer a business-friendly environment for the private sector; second, how public-private partnerships can foster stronger collaboration and exchange of knowledge and expertise between the public and private sectors; and finally, how the existing human capital constraints may be addressed through the effective implementation of talent management, knowledge management, and training programs. A comparative approach is taken throughout the book, contrasting the performance of GCC states with other Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries in key governance, public sector performance, and business competitiveness indicators - to identify what the GCC states need to do to enhance the quality of government and the capacity to deliver services more efficiently.

Why does it exist? What is it spent on? How much is it? And most importantly, does it work? The aid debate has been flooded by academic studies and popular books which either challenge or champion the effectiveness of aid. Most presume that the reader already knows the basic facts and characteristics of the aid industry. This book provides readers with a comprehensive summary of the background, actors, core principles and policies, and intended (and unintended) outcomes of foreign aid, followed by a more informed and balanced treatment of the key controversies and trends in aid today. Drawing on the author's 25 years' experience in development practice and 15 years in teaching, the book reflects on recent efforts to accelerate aid's impact and concludes by taking a balanced look at the future of aid and the headwinds it will face in the first half of the 21st century.

285597;"Shaping National Security : International Emergency Mechanisms and Disaster Risk Reduction /";;"""Shaping National Security: International Emergency Mechanisms and Disaster Risk Reduction presents international emergency mechanisms relative to disaster risk reduction (DRR). The goal is to share knowledge about existing frameworks, and utilize established DRR policies and programs, as another means to reinforce and strengthen national security in countries around the world. The book outlines, in detail, the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC), the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG), the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) DRR programs. While these entities' versions of DRR best practices are largely directed at decreasing the impact of disaster hazards, limiting relevant exposure, local vulnerabilities, increasing capacities to cope with disaster, the authors present these frameworks as potential tools, and effective means, to support national security efforts. This is especially important in disaster circumstances when local, and national emergency resources, may be insufficient to face hazards and multi-hazards, and result in cascading effects to occur as hazard events transpire. Chapters present various resources available to them, through these programs, to encourage authorities from every country to effectively apply the mechanisms-and emergency mechanisms specifically-to offer domestic solutions. Due to these programs proven track records in providing organisational standards, the use of such mechanisms can serve as both the basis to foster sound DRR practices and, by extension, can supplement resiliency, security, and continuity within countries. This concept is based on the premise that the UNDAC, INSARAG, NATO and ECPM emergency mechanisms have been developed to be implementable (directly or indirectly) in every country in the world when disasters occur. Shaping National Security takes a ""big-picture,"" holistic view of DRR and national security to offer innovative ideas and solutions to professionals and officials working in disaster management, disaster risk reduction, emergency management, crisis management, civil protection, public security management, national security, criminal justice, international studies, and homeland security""";"New York, NY : Routledge, 2024.

285608;"Contextualizing sectarianism in the Middle East and South Asia : identity, competition and conflict /";;"States across the Muslim world are faced with challenges associated with a perpetual cycle of conflict and violence organized along sectarian lines. To understand modern-day sectarianism, it is essential to move beyond explanations that focus predominantly on ancient Sunni-Shia animosities or a singular lens. It is important to engage in interdisciplinary and multidirectional examinations to better understand how sectarianism is strategically utilized by political entrepreneurs. Moreover, while religious identities and how individuals define themselves and their communities are important, it is also integral to analyze how identity has been utilized in historical and contemporary political contexts on state and non-state levels. This volume seeks to fill gaps in understanding the complexities associated with sectarianism through a transnational interdisciplinary analytical framework to enhance understanding of the socio-political, religio-political, cultural and security landscapes of the Middle East and South Asia. It also challenges narratives regarding sectarian divisions between Sunnis and Shias and deconstructs popular misconceptions about sectarianism, its spatial and temporal impact, as well as its influence on identities, conflict, and competition.

Their internal and external interactions are examined within their socio-political contexts to illuminate how they adapt to challenges or fail to do so. Unpacking the question of 'how do terrorists learn' helps us to grasp not only changes of violent means of action but also of operational and strategic approaches and, ultimately, even transformations of the ends pursued. The chapters demonstrate that terrorist learning is not principally different from that of other human organisations. The contributors draw on conceptual frameworks of organizational learning, but also broaden the scope beyond the organizational framework to acknowledge the variety of forms of informal and decentralized learning characteristic of much contemporary terrorism.

Coined the ""Gulf moment"" by local commentators, this regional trend reflects a redistribution of power in the Arab world. This is the first book to examine the military dimensions of these shifts. Gulf military strategy has prioritised the improvement of local armed forces and the diversification of defence partnerships towards countries such as Russia, Turkey or China. However, this book shows how this has led to the militarisation of Gulf societies, the further erosion of multilateral initiatives - including the Gulf Cooperation Council - and the Gulf's perilous involvement in the war in Yemen. The book also highlights enduring reliance on the West. Each chapter covers a key aspect of defence policy from governance of armed forces, military education and power projection capabilities to regional security cooperation and lessons from warfighting experiences. Close attention is paid to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, countries that have enjoyed prominent roles in the region's security affairs during the last ten years. The research is based on extensive fieldwork and interviews with major decision-makers, officials, and diplomatic and military representatives. It is also uses recently declassified official documents to gain rare insight into what Gulf countries intend for their defence policies.";"London, England : Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, 2023.

285618;"Macroeconomics and Financial Crises : Bound Together by Information Dynmmics /";"Gorton, Gary B.,";"""After the Great Depression John Maynard Keynes led the way in building a new macroeconomic framework to deal with that unprecedented economic reality. Ten years after our own crisis, however, macroeconomics has not come to terms with how to grapple with the idea of financial crises in its models. In the stylized world of macroeconomic theory, crises are not an inherent or structural element. Gary Gorton and Guillermo Ordonez, who were prominent experts to first authoritatively respond to the financial crisis of 2008 have since been working to understand what needs to change in macroeconomic models to incorporate and address financial crises. In this book Gorton and Ordonez provide an authoritative first step on how to rebuild macroeconomics in a way that can take into account financial crises, and they make a strong case that we need to rethink things at a fundamental level. In the book they bring together ten years of work on what needs to happen. Their two key ideas of what has missing are information and credit. More specifically, how information and credit interact, for example, when investors learn that certain types of debt aren't safe investments and we see bank runs. Gorton and Ordonez provide a way to model this interaction and a roadmap of how to incorporate it into a macroeconomic equilibrium"" | ""How financial crises are inherent features of macroeconomic dynamicsThere are no bigger disruptions in the functioning of economies than financial crises. Yet prior to the crash of 2007-2008, macroeconomics incorporated financial crises simply as bad shocks, like earthquakes, failing to consider them as an intrinsic phenomenon of the evolution of macroeconomic variables, such as credit, investment, and productivity. Macroeconomics and Financial Crises rethinks how technological change, credit booms, and endogenous information production combine to generate financial crises as inherent and recurrent reactions to macroeconomic dynamics.Gary Gorton and Guillermo Ordoñez identify short-term debt, collateral, and information as common elements that are present in all financial crises. Short-term debt is a critical element for storing value over short periods without fear of loss, but there needs to be collateral backing the debt. Critically, the collateral should be such that no agent wants to produce information about its quality. The debt backed by such collateral is information-insensitive. Gorton and Ordoñez argue that, during a credit boom, as more and more firms get loans, the economy reaches a tipping point where information production becomes too tempting, disrupting short-term debt and cutting most firms out of the credit market.Showing how a financial crisis is an information event triggered by the dynamics of macroeconomic variables, Macroeconomics and Financial Crises provides new perspectives on the intricate relations between macroeconomics and financial crises""";"Princeton, New Jersey : Princeton University Press, 2023.

Drawing on case studies, histories, and a rich, yet underexplored theoretical literature, this study presents students with the tools to methodically examine these often overlooked, but key drivers of violence in the international system. Additionally, globalization, the privatization of force, and the return of great power competition have altered the security landscape and enhanced armed group threats. These forces have also led to an increasing overlap between conflict and crime, and a growth in the state use of armed group proxies. Coming to terms with armed groups--their objectives, strategies, internal composition, and the environment that fosters them--remains a critical task for practitioners, scholars, and policy makers alike in understanding the changing nature of war.

It is already shaping the policy platforms of the US government, the European Union, and the Chinese Communist Party. But what, exactly, is the Metaverse? As pioneering theorist and venture capitalist Matthew Ball explains, it is a persistent and interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds that will eventually serve as the gateway to most online experiences, and also underpin much of the physical world. For decades, these ideas have been limited to science fiction and video games, but they are now poised to revolutionize every industry and function, from finance and healthcare to education, consumer products, city planning, dating, and well beyond. Taking us on an expansive tour of the ""next internet,"" Ball demonstrates that many proto-Metaverses are already here, such as Fortnite, Minecraft, and Roblox. Yet these offer only a glimpse of what is to come. Ball presents a comprehensive definition of the Metaverse before explaining the technologies that will power it-and the breakthroughs that will be necessary to fully realize it. He addresses the governance challenges the Metaverse entails; investigates the role of Web3, blockchains, and NFTs; and predicts Metaverse winners and losers. Most importantly, he examines many of the Metaverse's almost unlimited applications. The internet will no longer be at arm's length; instead, it will surround us, with much of our lives, labor, and leisure taking place inside the Metaverse. Bringing clarity and authority to a frequently misunderstood concept, Ball foresees trillions of dollars in new value-and the radical reshaping of society""--";" : Liveright Publishing Corporation, 2022.

285753;"Escalation Dynamics in Cyberspace / ";"Lonergan, Erica D.";"To what extent do cyberspace operations increase the risks of escalation between nation-state rivals? In Escalation Dynamics in Cyberspace, Erica D. Lonergan and Shawn W. Lonergan tackle this question head-on, presenting a comprehensive theory that explains the conditions under which cyber operations may lead to escalation. In doing so, they challenge long-held assumptions about strategic interactions in cyberspace, arguing that cyberspace is not as dangerous as the conventional wisdom might suggest. In some cases, cyber operations could even facilitate the de-escalation of international crises. Through extensive case studies that explore the role of cyber operations in routine competition, crises, and warfighting, Escalation Dynamics in Cyberspace presents nuanced insights about how cyberspace affects international politics.";"Oxford : Oxford University Press, Incorporated, 2023.

285754;"War, Peace and the Military : Sociological Perspectives /";"Kernic, Franz.";"This book is a comprehensive analysis of the various social science approaches to explaining and interpreting war, peace and the military. Its central aim is to trace and reconstruct those basic assumptions constructed and 'thought processes' undertaken by modern social sciences in their research and conceptualization of military violence and the use of force. In addition to such reconstruction, the aim is also to enquire into the preconditions of such thought. This study therefore eschews the development of an explicit 'strategy' (in the sense of a research strategy), but instead is much more concerned with thinking about its subject matter by means of re-thinking and reflecting upon different theoretical approaches and problems. The investigation includes a critical reexamination of the tradition of military-sociological research from the beginning of modern sociology to late-twentieth century theoretical approaches regarding the security-focused and/or war-driven aspects of modern society.";"Wiesbaden : Springer Vieweg. in Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, 2023.

285755;"Grand Delusion : The Rise and Fall of American Ambition in the Middle East /";"Simon, Steven.";"""A longtime American foreign policy insider's biting and definitive reckoning with the high cost of this country's ambitious meddling in the Middle East-and its bitter end The culmination of almost 40 years of expertise and insider policy access, Grand Delusion is Steven Simon's tour de force, offering a comprehensive yet analytical tour of U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Simon begins with the Reagan administration, when the Middle East shifted from a group of faraway and frequently squabbling nations to an urgent opportunity for America to (in Reagan's words) ""serve the cause of world peace and the future of mankind."" Assuring citizens that ""we owe it to ourselves and to our children"" to be a force for peace in the region, Reagan fired the starting gun on decades of profound American involvement. As the U.S. economy became increasingly reliant on oil and as policy and diplomatic momentum gathered, the Middle East became more and more central to foreign policy, and more and more likely to be the subject of grand rhetoric, until the Obama administration ended an era by turning away from the region. Grand Delusion explores the motivations, approach, and legacy of each administration up to today, showing us a complex spiderweb of intertwined events-from Lebanese civil conflict to shifting Iranian domestic politics, to Saudi Arabia's quest for security-through the lens of a Washington policy process frequently ruled by cognitive bias, wishful thinking, and outright malfeasance. Simon's sharp sense of humor and incisive analytical powers bring a complex history to life. Despite an impressive DC resume-he rose to become the National Security Council senior director for Middle Eastern and North African affairs-Simon never fails to tell the truth as he sees it. He challenges the nature of American commitment to Israel; disputes the popular narrative of Desert Storm as a ""good war""; and calls out the enormous consequences of our mistakes, particularly for victims of American military action. As Grand Delusion shows, this story is only occasionally impressive, and frequently disgraceful. But it's a story with deep and enduring resonance for the future of both the U.S. and the Middle East""--";"New York : Penguin Publishing Group, 2023.

Drawing on empirical evidence, it first assesses the structure of the industry, the methods think tanks use to persuade policymakers, and public perceptions of their effectiveness. The book then proceeds to examine three unique policy cases to analyse think tank influence on policymaking. It argues that whilst think tanks play important roles in Australia's policy process, their impacts vary depending on their approach and objectives. The book also demonstrates that policymakers with contrasting ideological orientations diverge in their assessments of the utility and influence of think tanks.

285757;"One Nation Under Drones : Legality, Morality, and Utility of Unmanned Combat Systems /";"Jackson, John E.";"""One Nation Under Drones is an interesting and informative review of how robotic and unmanned systems are impacting every aspect of American life, from how we fight our wars to how we play to how we grow our food. Edited by John Jackson, this highly readable book features chapters from a dozen experts, researchers, and operators of the sophisticated systems that have become ubiquitous across the nation and around the world. Press reports have focused primarily on unmanned aerial vehicles, officially designated as UAVs, but more often referred to as ""drones.""  This work takes you behind the scenes and describes how Predators, Reapers, Scan Eagles, and dozens of other pilotless aircraft have been used to fight the Global War on Terrorism. Although these systems seemed to emerge fully-developed into the skies above America's distant battlefields following the attacks of September 11, 2001, readers will discover that they actually trace their lineage to World War I, when the ""automatic airplane/aerial torpedo,"" designed and built by the Sperry Gyroscope Company, made its first flight just over a century ago. Unmanned aircraft were used by various combatants in World War II and took many forms: from converted manned bombers to intercontinental attacks on the American homeland by rice-paper balloons. Technology developed in the latter decades of the 20th century enabled crews stationed thousands of miles away to attack targets on remote battlefields. Such long-range and remote-controlled weapons have been extensively used but are controversial from both legal and ethical standpoints. Chapters written by international law specialists and drone pilots with advanced education in ethics address these issues from both sides of the argument. The book also details how robotic systems are being used on land, in and below the seas, and in civilian applications such as driverless cars. Three dozen photographs display drones as small as an insect up to those as large as a 737 airliner. One Nation Under Drones covers such a wide array of topics that it will be of interest to everyone from the casual reader seeking to know more about these systems to national security professionals, both in and out of uniform, who will be making decisions about their procurement and use in decades to come.

285758;"Quantum Supremacy : How the Quantum Computer Revolution Will Change Everything /";"Kaku, Michio.";"""An exhilarating tour of humanity's next great technological achievement-quantum computing-which may eventually unravel the deepest mysteries of science and solve some of humanity's biggest problems, like global warming, world hunger, and incurable disease, by the bestselling author of The God Equation. The runaway success of the microchip processor may be reaching its end. Running up against the physical constraints of smaller and smaller sizes, traditional silicon chips are not likely to prove useful in solving humanity's greatest challenges, from climate change, to global starvation, to incurable diseases. But the quantum computer, which harnesses the power and complexity of the atomic realm, already promises to be every bit as revolutionary as the transistor and microchip once were. Its unprecedented gains in computing power herald advancements that could change every aspect of our daily lives. Automotive companies, medical researchers, and consulting firms are betting on quantum computing, hoping to exploit its power to design more efficient vehicles, create life-saving new drugs, and streamline industries to revolutionize the economy. But this is only the beginning. Quantum computers could allow us to finally create nuclear fusion reactors that create clean, renewable energy without radioactive waste or threats of meltdown. They could help us crack the biological processes that generate natural, cheap fertilizer and enable us to feed the world's growing populations. And they could unravel the fiendishly difficult protein folding that lies at the heart of previously incurable diseases like Alzheimer's, ALS, and Parkinson's, helping us to live longer, healthier lives. There is not a single problem humanity faces that couldn't be addressed by quantum computing. Told with Kaku's signature clarity and enthusiasm, Quantum Supremacy is the story of this exciting frontier and the race to claim humanity's future""--";"New York : Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2023.

285760;"Deep Loyalties : Values in Military Lives /";"Wortmeyer, Daniela Schmitz.";"""Cultural practices and artifacts, in their multiple and varied forms, are grounded on values, which are so deeply internalized by people that usually remain in the background, as taken-for-granted guides for interpretations and decisions in everyday life. Shaping individual moral horizons is at the core of socialization processes, through which older generations aim to disseminate their culturally established values to the new ones, making use of suggestions mainly implicit in daily experiences and interactions. Despite the strength of these processes of cultural canalization, people find particular ways of positioning and interpreting social suggestions, drawing singular life trajectories and developing themselves as unique beings. This is truthful also in case of highly institutionalized settings like the military, in which people play in many forms an agentic role in their own development, being prepared to perform their professional duties in very complex and challenging activity contexts. This book is an invitation to dive deeper into human experiences lived in the military through qualitative and in-depth approaches, observing their affective qualities, the meanings they acquire and how they shape individuals' identities, fostering the development and try-out of specific ethical and moral values. The present work can contribute to research and professional practice in fields related to human development, social processes, education and people management in the military, as well as in other institutional contexts, especially by highlighting the affective, meaningful and moral-ethical dimensions of cultural experiences""--";"Charlotte, NC : Information Age Publishing, Incorporated, 2022.

This book also covers operational security approaches to cyber, alongside detailed descriptions of contemporary cybersecurity threats, in the context of psychological and criminal profiling of cybercriminals. Following an analysis of the plethora of counterespionage techniques that can be mapped to the cyber realm, the mechanics of undertaking technical surveillance are reviewed. A range of approaches to web and forum surveillance are outlined as a virtual addition to traditional video and audio surveillance captured regarding targets. This includes a description of the advances in Artificial Intelligence, predictive analysis, support for the disciplines of digital forensics, behavioural analysis and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT). The rise of disinformation and misinformation and the veracity of widespread false flag claims are discussed at length, within the broader context of legal and ethical issues in cyber counterintelligence. This book is designed for professionals working in the intelligence, law enforcement or cybersecurity domains to further explore and examine the contemporary intersection of these disciplines. Students studying cybersecurity, justice, law, intelligence, criminology or related fields may also find the book useful as a reference volume, while instructors could utilise the whole volume or individual chapters as a secondary textbook or required reading.

285764;"War, State and Sovereignty : Interdisciplinary Challenges and Perspectives for the Social Sciences /";"Daho, Grégory.";"This book addresses the links between war, state and sovereignty using an interdisciplinary approach. The authors and editors investigate the transformation of the state through the practices of security governance - an effective way to question the evolution of authority and legitimacy of state violence, and the organisation of human societies. This work contributes to the understanding of the transformation of state through the prism of security challenges and provides the means to identify the evolution of their regalian contours, the legal and technical forms of regulating violence, and the legitimisation of public power. This volume shows that the contribution of the social sciences is decisive for understanding the changes of the role and insertion of armed forces in their political, social and professional environment.

285765;"The Arms Race in the Middle East : Contemporary Security Dynamics /";"Eslami, Mohammad.";"This edited volume discusses security policy and strategic policymaking in the Middle East region. Due to its unique geopolitical, geoeconomic and geostrategic features, the Middle East region has been confronted with challenging security issues. Combined with a lack of an efficient regional security regime this has led to the formation of a full-fledged arms race. This book draws together contributions from international experts to address the factors that have been contributing to the ongoing formation of an arms race in the Middle East as well as the impact of this phenomenon on the regional and global security environment. The book is organized in three sections. The first section outlines the contemporary dynamics of the arms race in the Middle East by focusing on its most recent dynamics and their implications for regional and international security. The second section conducts systematic analysis of case studies of country-specific drivers of the arms race. The third and final section examines the role of external actors in the arms race, evaluating both the responses of regional actors to external interventions as well as the implications of the arms race for extra-regional countries.

It explains why cyberdefense organized and performed by humans is too slow, too cumbersome, and too ineffective. Combining the analytical capabilities of experts in operations research and management, international security studies, economics, risk analysis, and defense management, the volume addresses these problems of current cyberdefense. The authors present suggestions for the next generation of cyberdefense, explaining why the future defense must focus on speeding up responses, why a single response may not be enough, and why effectiveness requires foresight.This makes the book a must-read for scholars, researchers, intelligence analysts, homeland security staff, and professionals who are interested in learning more about the issues of current cyberdefense, as well as solutions for the next generation of cyberdefense.";"Cham : Springer International Publishing AG, 2023.

285769;"Overlapping Regional Orders in the Middle East and North Africa : Norms and Social Practices of Foreign Behaviour /";"Quero, Jordi.";"Focused on a set of overlapping international orders of regional scope present in the Middle East and North Africa, this book argues that rules and primary institutions have sanctioned the foreign behavior of the sub-system's international actors since 1945.The author avoids recent IR trends focused on narrow case studies, instead providing a comprehensive overview of the MENA's regional politics. The normative content and evolution of multiple international orders are examined, constituting the intra-Arab order, the Arab-Israeli order and the Arab-Iranian order, as well as the expression of the global order in regional interactions. Drawing on Area Studies and English School and constructivist IR theories, the author argues that a plurality of overlapping regional orders have coexisted since 1945, not just one as is commonly suggested in the literature. Each of these orders is integrated by different participants and has developed its own differentiated norms and institutions setting parameters on legitimate behavior. This analytical proposal helps make sense of foreign relations otherwise labeled as incoherent.The book has wide appeal, accessible both to students wishing to learn about the politics, history and sociology of the Middle East, as well as to specialists seeking original research on the functioning of the MENA's regional orders.";"Milton : Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2023.

A framework to study both empirically and theoretically is presented in a detailed manner so that it may become a resource for understanding the challenges of climate refugees. Through discussion and analysis the book presents potential answers to such questions as: ● Why has the international system been so short-sighted and has not given importance to the problems of climate migrants and refugees? ● How to identify a climate refugee? ● How do you justify a climate refugee or a migrant? ● What are internally displaced people? Should we call them just refugees? The book covers the interdisciplinary nature of climate refugees and the perspectives of social science. The empirical findings provides an edge to holistically understanding climate refugees. This book discusses the concept of, what really is a climate refugee, and the necessary factors to make it an important part of the climate discourse. The legality of the term is missing in international parlance, and the academic discourse should provide the necessary critique required for the evolution of the subject under study.

Showcasing the breadth and diversity of modern militias in the context of violence against civilians, the volume addresses the predation and repression that many such groups are infamous for, as well as increasingly important efforts by other militias at civilian protection in war-torn settings. The chapters examine militias from around the world, drawing on both qualitative and quantitative methods as they cover groups as varied as gangs, death squads. grassroots community-defense groups, official state militias, and party-sponsored armies -- groups on the ""civic vice"" side, the ""civic virtue"" side, and the wide and mixed in-between space where most cases fall. Taken as a cohesive unit, the work lays the foundation for an encompassing theory and interrogation of the causal chain between militia type and operating context and the levels of violence against civilians. It provides path-breaking theory-building and empirical scholarship. Policymakers and national-security practitioners dealing with issues relating to armed groups will also benefit from the practical issues covered here, such as how different forms of sponsorship and training affect militia behavior.

One of the most noteworthy global aspects in current societies is the intensifying presence of technology, to the extent that we can talk about the omnipotence of technologies, a kind of technological imperative that prevails in societies. This new type of technological imperative emerges in the working lives of practicing professionals from medical doctors to lawyers and from teachers to preachers. Platforms have become a powerful actor as enablers and reorganizers of work, creating new types of inequalities but also expanding the market relations for new professions such as social influencers.

285778;"The bounds of defense : killing, moral responsibility, and war /";"Strawser, Bradley Jay,";"Most people believe that killing someone, while generally morally wrong, can in some cases be a permissible act. Most people similarly believe that war, while awful, can be justified. Bradley Jay Strawser examines a set of related moral issues in war: when it is permissible to kill in defense of others; what moral responsibility would be required to be liable for such defensive killing; how that permission can extend to whole groups of people; and, lastly, what values undergird the permissibility of that defense, such as individual autonomy. Strawser argues for a rights-based account of permissible defensive harm and an 'evidence-relative' basis for the holding those responsible. His view is that in order to be properly responsible for an unjust harm to be justifiably killed, one must act wrongly according to the evidence available to them.Extending this view, Strawser explores how such a rights-based model can make sense of the wide-spread destructive harms of war. He endorses a revisionist approach to just war theory and argues in its defense; and he also shows how his evidence-relative account supports revisionist just war theory by better grounding it in the real world of modern warfare. Lastly, he offers a new proposal for how targeting in war could better align with respect for the rights of individual persons, and demonstrate how revisionist just war theory-and any rights-respecting just war account more broadly-could conceivably work in practical ways.";"New York, NY : Oxford University Press, 2023.

285782;"AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning : A Security Perspective /";;"""Today Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL) have become the hottest areas in the information technology. In our society, there are so many intelligent devices that rely on AI/ML/DL algorithms/tools for smart operations. Although AI/ML/DL algorithms/tools have used in many Internet applications and electronic devices, they are also vulnerable to various attacks and threats. The AI parameters may be distorted by the internal attacker; the DL input samples may be polluted by adversaries; the ML model may be misled by changing the classification boundary, and many other attacks/threats. Those attacks make the AI products dangerous to use. While the above discussion focuses on the security issues in AI/ML/DL-based systems (i.e., securing the intelligent systems themselves), AI/ML/DL models/algorithms can be used for cyber security (i.e., use AI to achieve security). Since the AI/ML/DL security is a new emergent field, many researchers and industry people cannot obtain detailed, comprehensive understanding of this area. This book aims to provide a complete picture on the challenges and solutions to the security issues in various applications. It explains how different attacks can occur in advanced AI tools and the challenges of overcoming those attacks.

They must balance what they know, which is necessarily drawn from the past, with what they intuit about the future, which is inherently conjectural and uncertain. It is this intuitive grasp of direction that enables leaders to set objectives and lay down a strategy.""   In Leadership, Kissinger analyses the lives of six extraordinary leaders through the distinctive strategies of statecraft, which he believes they embodied. After the Second World War, Konrad Adenauer brought defeated and morally bankrupt Germany back into the community of nations by what Kissinger calls ""the strategy of humility."" Charles de Gaulle set France beside the victorious Allies and renewed its historic grandeur by ""the strategy of will."" During the Cold War, Richard Nixon gave geostrategic advantage to the United States by ""the strategy of equilibrium."" After twenty-five years of conflict, Anwar Sadat brought a vision of peace to the Middle East by a ""strategy of transcendence."" Against the odds, Lee Kuan Yew created a powerhouse city-state, Singapore, by ""the strategy of excellence."" And, though Britain was known as ""the sick man of Europe"" when Margaret Thatcher came to power, she renewed her country's morale and international position by ""the strategy of conviction.""   To each of these studies, Kissinger brings historical perception, public experience and--because he knew each of the subjects and participated in many of the events he describes--personal knowledge. Leadership is enriched by insights and judgements that only Kissinger could make and concludes with his reflections on world order and the indispensability of leadership today.";"New York : Penguin Publishing Group, 2022.

Whilst the Gulf region has at times been seen as impervious to this natural phenomenon of transformation -- timeless, never changing, deeply rooted in its ancient tribal customs and traditions and able to blend past and present seamlessly without suffering the wrenching trauma of change -- this is clearly not the case, and the region is not immune to the inevitable forces of social change. There is no doubt today that the social change sweeping the Gulf has been profound, affecting almost every aspect of life in the Gulf societies. This volume has an encyclopedic value as the chapters collectively offer multifaceted and multidisciplinary perspectives to understand social change in the Gulf region.

Through its rich compilation of empirical qualitative research, the text unpacks the various ways in which women's empowerment materializes in the GCC context, providing insights into public policy perspectives in high-income rentier states more broadly. The Arab world has long been part of the global dialogue on women's economic and political empowerment and the GCC has, over the past decade, situated women's empowerment amongst their respective national priorities and long-term strategies. In turn, the Gulf has seen gradual implementation of policies aimed at women, specifically, in looking to attract and retain them in the labour market, and in the public sector more broadly. The collection surveys and evaluates the progress made in recent decades, paying close attention to the cultural and policy constraints still limiting women's empowerment in the Gulf.

Intelligence collection by agencies such as the CIA, MI6, and Mossad involves practices that are apparently inconsistent with the principles of ordinary morality - practices such as lying, spying, manipulation, and covert action. However, in the defence of national security, such practices may not only be morally permissible, but may also under some circumstances be morally obligatory. One approach to the ethics of national security intelligence activity has been to draw from the just war tradition (so-called 'just intelligence theory'). This book identifies significant limitations of this approach and offers a new, institutionally based, teleological normative framework. In doing so, it revises some familiar principles designed for application to kinetic wars, such as necessity and proportionality, and invokes some additional ones, such as reciprocity and trust. It goes on to explore the applications of this framework and a revised set of principles for national security intelligence institutions and practices in contemporary and emerging political and technological settings.

Appropriate touch from robots to humans is essential for social robots, but achieving this requires various solutions at every stage of the touch process. Through this book, readers will gain an understanding of the needs, essential systems and communication cues, behaviour designs, and real-world issues for social touch applications. This book compiles and updates technical and empirical research that was previously scattered throughout the literature into a single volume. Through individually authored chapters addressing various elements of ATR's CREST project, this book tackles key areas where understanding is needed to realize acceptable touch interaction, including pre-touch interaction, interaction design for touching and being touched, behaviour changes caused by touch interaction, and applications of social touch interaction. It introduces a touch sensor and robots developed by the authors, including several touch-related behaviours and design policies. This approach will enable readers to easily apply this knowledge to their own social robotics programs. This book is invaluable for anyone who wishes to understand and develop social robots that physically interact with people.

In 2015, Industry 4.0 was announced with the rise of industrialization by the European Parliament, supporting policy, research, and infrastructure funding. In 2020, Industry 5.0 was launched as an evolution of Industry 4.0, towards societal and ecological values in a sustainable, human-centric, and resilient transition. In 2023, the IN4ACT research project team completed 4 years of research on the impact on these initiatives. Presentations reviewing the progress of management practices and economics led to conversations about what's next. The unanticipated rise in late 2022 of Generative AI technologies (e.g. ChatGPT, DALL-E) sparked dialogues with an extended circle of researchers on impacts not considered in 2015 or in 2020.

286488;"Private sector development in an emerging world : inclusive policies and strategies for the formal and informal economy /";;"This book explores the interactions between private sector development, public policies and societal institutions with a strong view on contributing to sustainable and inclusive development in emerging countries.

The private sector is often praised as an engine of economic growth. This belief has led to significant efforts to promote private sector development in emerging countries. Development agencies prioritize private sector development and national governments are following suit, resulting in often huge incentives to stimulate and attract private investment.

However, private sector development is not a panacea for sustainable and inclusive development as the past decades have clearly shown. Economic growth, societal development and environmental sustainability are often in a sharp conflict; and more often than not economic growth has failed to improve the lives of all citizens.

This book examines the role the state and the private sector should play to benefit from the dynamics of business development, while ensuring that these benefits are shared broadly without jeopardizing sustainability. The views presented differ in detail, but the analyses and case studies presented share common themes, namely that the relative roles of state and private sector of should be balanced and that this particular balance should be based on the context of each country in order to make the private-public sector interaction work for all people.";"Boston : De Gruyter, 2023.

286489;"Human-centered economics : the living standards of nations /";"Samans, Richard,";"This open access book examines the chronic underperformance of economies with respect to inclusion, sustainability and resilience. It finds that the standard liberal economic growth and development model has evolved over the past century in a fundamentally unbalanced manner that underemphasizes the crucial role of institutions legal norms, policy incentives and public administrative capacities in translating market-based growth in the production of goods and services into broad and sustainable gains in social welfare at the household level. Correcting this imbalance of emphasis in economic theory and policy between markets and institutions, production and distribution, and national income and household living standards is the single most important step required to transcend 20th century trickle-down neoliberalism and replace it with a more human-centred model of economic progress in the 21st century. The book breaks new ground by integrating the principal institutional dimensions of the social contract into the heart of macroeconomic theory and presenting extensive corresponding reforms of domestic and international economic policy to refocus them on the median living standards, rather than primarily aggregate wealth or GDP, of nations. This is the bottom-line measure of national economic performance, and it depends on the strength of both markets of exchange and institutions in such areas as labour and social protection, financial and corporate governance, competition and rents, anti-corruption, infrastructure and basic necessities, environmental protection, education and skilling, etc. Extensive comparative data are presented demonstrating that countries at every level of economic development have ample policy space to narrow their welfare gaps their underperformance on these and other key aspects of household living standards relative to the frontier of leading policy practice in peer countries.

This volume addresses this gap with a set of empirically rich, theory driven case studies written by academics from or based in the countries in question. The underlying assumption is not that Asian powers have already become important security actors in the Gulf, but rather that they perceive the Gulf as a region of increasing strategic relevance. How will leaders in these countries adjust to an evolving regional framework? Will there be coordinated efforts to establish an Asian-centered approach to Gulf stability, or will Asian rivalries make the region a theatre of competition? Will US-China tensions force alignment choices among Asian powers? Will Asian states balance, bandwagon, hedge, or adopt some other approach to their Gulf relationships? These questions become even more important as the western boundaries of Asia increasingly come to incorporate the Middle East. The book will appeal to scholars and students in the fields of International Relations, Security Studies, and International Political Economy, as well as area specialists on the Gulf and those working on foreign policy issues on each of the Asian countries included.

286502;"Artificial intelligence and international conflict in cyberspace / ";;"""This edited volume explores how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming international conflict in cyberspace. Over the past three decades, cyberspace developed into a crucial frontier and issue of international conflict. However, scholarly work on the relationship between AI and conflict in cyberspace has been produced along somewhat rigid disciplinary boundaries and an even more rigid sociotechnical divide - wherein technical and social scholarship are seldomly brought into a conversation. This is the first volume to address these themes through a comprehensive and cross-disciplinary approach. With the intent of exploring the question 'what is at stake with the use of automation in international conflict in cyberspace through AI?', the chapters in the volume focus on three broad themes, namely: (1) technical and operational, (2) strategic and geopolitical, and (3) normative and legal. These also constitute the three parts in which the chapters of this volume are organised, although these thematic sections should not be considered as an analytical or a disciplinary demarcation.

The West needs to learn how to act strategically in a world where they are no longer the number 1. Part Two The Return of Asia. From the years 1 to 1820, the largest economies in the world were Asian. After 1820 and the rise of the West, however, great Asian civilizations like China and India were dominated and humiliated.

The shift in the balance of power to the East has been most pronounced in the rise of China. While this rise has been peaceful, many in the West have responded with considerable concern over the influence China will have on the world order.

Over the past century and a half, industrially drilled petroleum has powered factories, built cities, and sustained nation-states. It has fueled ways of life and visions of progress, modernity, and disaster. In detailed international case studies, the contributors consider petroleum's role in the built environment and the imagination. They study how petroleum and its infrastructure have served as a source of military conflict and political and economic power, inspiring efforts to create territories and reshape geographies and national boundaries. The authors trace ruptures and continuities between colonial and postcolonial frameworks, in locations as diverse as Sumatra, northeast China, Brazil, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Kuwait as well as heritage sites including former power stations in Italy and the port of Dunkirk, once a prime gateway through which petroleum entered Europe. By revealing petroleum's role in organizing and imagining space globally, this book takes up a key task in imagining the possibilities of a post-oil future.

Cyber warfare and information warfare are different beasts. Both concern information, but where the former does so exclusively in its digitized and operationalized form, the latter does so in a much broader sense: with IW, information itself is the weapon. The present work aims to help scholars, analysts and policymakers understand IW within the context of cyber conflict. Specifically, the chapters in the volume address the shape of influence campaigns waged across digital infrastructure and in the psychology of democratic populations in recent years by belligerent state actors, from the Russian Federation to the Islamic Republic of Iran. In marshalling evidence on the shape and evolution of IW as a broad-scoped phenomenon aimed at societies writ large, the authors in this book present timely empirical investigations into the global landscape of influence operations, legal and strategic analyses of their role in international politics, and insightful examinations of the potential for democratic process to overcome pervasive foreign manipulation.

Through case studies of the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, Peter S. Henne demonstrates that religion, although not as high profile or well-funded a tool as economic sanctions or threats of military force, remains a potent weapon in international relations. Public policy analysis often minimizes the role of religion, favoring military or economic matters as the ""important"" arenas of policy debate. As Henne shows, however, at transformative moments in political history, states turn to faith-based appeals to integrate or fragment international coalitions. Henne highlights Saudi Arabia's 1960s rivalry with Egypt, the United States's post-9/11 leadership in the global war on terrorism, and the Russian Federation's contemporary expansionism both to reveal the presence and power of calls for religious unity and to emphasize the uncertainty and anxiety such appeals can create.

286866;"Creative insecurity : institutional inertia and youth potential in the GCC /";"Thafer, Dania,";"The Middle East is experiencing the world's most prominent youth bulge. Yet many MENA economies' institutional designs, both formal and informal, favour the power of business elites, systematically discriminating against young people joining the workforce or opening businesses, and thus limiting their ability to contribute to innovation. Large youth populations can be a boon or a curse: nurtured and integrated, they can jumpstart stratospheric growth; but if alienated and confined, they can drain a society politically and economically. The Gulf Cooperation Council countries are no exception to this perilous dilemma. This book explores the problem through a new concept, 'creative insecurity': a state's subjection to an institutional ecosystem that is suppressing opportunities for innovation--to the extent that it is causing economic and political vulnerabilities, which in turn threaten national security. Creative insecurity threatens the longevity of many states today. In this original, incisive study, Dania Thafer argues that GCC member-states should make it a national security imperative to cash in their demographic dividend, by averting the deleterious effects of ill-disposed elite politics. Investing in an innovation ecosystem that harnesses the talent of the youth majority will be crucial for the GCC's successful transition to the post-oil era.";"London, England : C. Hurst &amp; Co.

286868;"Digital empires : the global battle to regulate technology /";"Bradford, Anu,";"Financial Times Best Books of 2023 in Economics The global battle among the three dominant digital powers--the United States, China, and the European Union--is intensifying. All three regimes are racing to regulate tech companies, with each advancing a competing vision for the digital economy while attempting to expand its sphere of influence in the digital world. In Digital Empires, her provocative follow-up to The Brussels Effect, Anu Bradford explores a rivalry that will shape the world in the decades to come. Across the globe, people dependent on digital technologies have become increasingly alarmed that their rapid adoption and transformation have ushered in an exceedingly concentrated economy where a few powerful companies control vast economic wealth and political power, undermine data privacy, and widen the gap between economic winners and losers. In response, world leaders are variously embracing the idea of reining in the most dominant tech companies. Bradford examines three competing regulatory approaches--the American market-driven model, the Chinese state-driven model, and the European rights-driven regulatory model--and discusses how governments and tech companies navigate the inevitable conflicts that arise when these regulatory approaches collide in the international domain. Which digital empire will prevail in the contest for global influence remains an open question, yet their contrasting strategies are increasingly clear. Digital societies are at an inflection point. In the midst of these unfolding regulatory battles, governments, tech companies, and digital citizens are making important choices that will shape the future ethos of the digital society. Digital Empires lays bare the choices we face as societies and individuals, explains the forces that shape those choices, and illuminates the immense stakes involved for everyone who uses digital technologies.";"New York, NY : Oxford University Press, 2023 ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286868
286869;"Foreign policy and security strategy / ";;"Foreign Policy and Security Strategy collects works by the late Professor Martin Wight (1913-1972), an historian and scholar of international relations. Wight conducted research on many topics, including British colonial history, European studies, international institutions, and the history of states-systems. He is nonetheless best known for his lectures about the political philosophy of international relations at the London School of Economics (1949-1961) and the University of Sussex (1961-1972). He is widely regarded as an intellectual ancestor and pathbreaker of the ""English School"" of international relations, even though this term only gained currency nine years after his death. The ""English School"" is usually construed as signifying an approach to the study of international relations more rooted in historical and humanistic learning than in the social sciences. Despite Wight's reputation as a scholar focused on historical and philosophical matters, he articulated noteworthy policy prescriptions in six domains: (a) the balance of power; (b) international order, notably regarding neutrality and nationalism; (c) nuclear weapons and international politics; (d) interests, honour, and prestige in statecraft; (e) disarmament and public opinion; and (f) the United Nations. These writings have been neglected, partly because his perfectionism led him to refrain from publishing many of them. However, as this new collection of his works (many previously unpublished) shows, he took distinctive positions on practical policy questions. He asked ""Does Peace Take Care of Itself?"" - as implied by Kantian principles - and concluded that it does not, and that purposeful action will therefore be necessary.";"Oxford, England : Oxford University Press, 2023 ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286869

Three novel humanist conceptions are introduced: common good governance, transnational networked cooperation, and humanity's security. This academic volume is the first to survey the threats to peace in the shifting world order by investigating the current patterns and trends in the global use of, and investment in, militarizing AI and the development of autonomous systems. Garcia weaves in an insider participant-observer focus on the decade-long high-level diplomatic attempts to set limits in autonomy in weapons systems - known as 'killer robots' - and offers a path for the creation of an international treaty on autonomous weapons, and ways to create common good governance for the militarization of AI. This important study draws on earlier successful cooperation and international law-making in several areas including conventional arms, nuclear and chemical weapons bans, the protection of outer space and the ozone, the Arctic, Antarctica, and the oceans. It offers an appraisal of the way that previous successes in global cooperation can inform the formation of common good governance on AI that is respectful of future generations and protective of human dignity and the common good of humanity.";"Oxford, England : Oxford University Press, 2023 ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286870

The inherent contradictions in this situation have left many analysts at a loss. Hamas uses terror tactics against Israel, yet runs on a law and order ticket in Palestinian elections; it pursues an Islamic state, yet holds internal elections; it campaigns for shar'iah law, yet its leaders are predominantly secular professionals; it calls for the destruction of Israel, yet has reluctantly agreed to honour previous peace agreements. In ""Hamas in Politics"", Jeroen Gunning challenges the assumption that religion, violence and democracy are inherently incompatible and shows how many of these apparent contradictions flow from the interaction between Hamas' ideology, its local constituency and the nature of politics in Israel/Palestine. Drawing on interviews with members of Hamas and its critics, and a decade of close observation of the group, he offers a penetrating analysis of Hamas' own understanding of its ideology and in particular the tension between its dual commitment to 'God' and 'the people'. The book explores what Hamas' political practice says about its attitude towards democracy, religion and violence, providing a unique examination of the movement's internal organisation, how its leaders are selected and how decisions are made.";"London, England : C.

For smallness-often regarded as a weakness-can be a strength. It may induce insecurity in states, but also endows them with an instinct for survival. Large states are ponderous; small states can be agile and adaptive.Drawing on his deep experience as a scientist, businessman, diplomat and head of state, Sarkissian offers captivating portraits of small states, from Africa to Europe to Asia, that have overcome seemingly insuperable odds to establish themselves as oases of political stability, cultural tolerance, technological innovation, financial prudence and scientific research. Sarkissian returns to the uncertain beginnings of these small states to demystify their improbable rise. Along the way, he introduces us to a cast of tenacious leaders with a knack for converting crisis into opportunity. Widely regarded as the most respected Armenian leader on the world stage, Sarkissian ends with a poignant homage to his motherland.

It surveys the myriad factors which have influenced the emergence of these states, societies and political economies, which have become increasingly assertive actors in today's global order.Exploring domestic, regional and transnational pressures, Kristian Coates Ulrichsen sheds light on the varying concepts of power and authority, the different forms they take, the ways they are projected, and the practical constraints on their exercise. From whom does power derive? Is it something different from influence and ambition? Is decision-making top-down or bottom-up, or a mixture of both?

Analysis of developing countries tends to be preoccupied with the seedier aspects of politics, finding explanations for lack of progress in vote-buying, clientelism and naked self-interest. But this ignores the question of why politicians, as people, do what they do. Drawing on the experiences of hundreds of MPs in some of the world's most complex environments, Greg Power explores their personal motivations and daily pressures in filling the gaps left by failing states. In countries as diverse as Iraq, Nepal, Ukraine and Tanzania, he shows how institutions work within highly informal political cultures, driven by public expectations, social norms, reciprocity and altruism. He reveals that development is determined as much by MPs' foibles and preferences as by the wider battle for power. Combining insights from political science, behavioural economics and business management, Power argues for a more human approach to political reform--one that starts with individuals, not institutions. His fascinating book shines new light on how politics works from the inside, and why the human element is central to making change happen where it really matters.";"London, England : C.

Cyber, robotics and AI, for example, have inspired an abundant and flourishing literature. One trend, however, has been largely overlooked: the emergence of special operations as a prominent instrument of statecraft. Drawing extensively on historical cases and first-hand experience, the authors of this book call attention to qualities inherent in special operations - and special operators - that challenge the moral framework which has long informed conventional military operations. Moral theorists will find this analysis provocative, while practitioners - those who conduct or oversee special operations and have an interest in the moral wellbeing of special operators - can put the authors' insights to practical use. Those who simply view with fascination the opaque world of special operations will find this book illuminating.";"Cambridge, England : Cambridge University Press, 2024 ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=286879
286880;"Power couple : Russian-Iranian alignment in the Middle East /";"Tazmini, Ghoncheh,";"Cooperation between Iran and Russia has expanded to unprecedented levels. Following the Russian offensive in Ukraine, their partnership has undergone a significant transformation, altering power dynamics and elevating Iran from a junior partner to an equal counterpart. Russia's dependence on Iran in unexpected areas has caught observers by surprise. In her book, Ghoncheh Tazmini presents a fresh analysis of the complex relationship between Russia and Iran. She argues for a Russia-Iran 'alignment' based on their shared narratives of the international order. The two states are bound by connective tissue that is coded by ontological security preoccupations and mutual threat perceptions. Despite historical animosities and ongoing suspicions, the relationship has demonstrated resilience, fluctuating between conflict and convergence.The Iran-Russia relationship holds decisive implications for the Middle East's future, where their interests both overlap and diverge, notably in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and with the GCC. Tazmini delves into Russian and Iranian geopolitical aspirations in the Middle Eastern theatre and addresses how evolving international realities impact their regional policies. Through a blend of sophisticated theoretical analysis and empirical insights, Tazmini explains why Moscow-Tehran relations are more durable than many in the Western world and the Middle East may perceive. Russia and Iran's close alignment is expected to persist - undeterred by criticism and sanctions, the 'Power Couple' remains determined to establish a foothold in the international system through their collaborative efforts.";"London, England : I.B.

286882;"Arab-Israel normalisation of ties : global perspectives /";;"This book focuses on rapprochement and normalisation between Israel and some Arab countries within the context of global and regional geopolitics, bringing together broader perspectives on transformations resulting from this. The analysis is rooted in a historical and cultural construction of the region as an Islamic sphere viewing Israel as a perpetuation of the Western colonial project in the region. It analyses how this normalisation must not be treated as a novel phenomenon, but as a reconstruction of the past and continuity in tradition geared at regional stability, signifying a wider shift in the structure of the global international system. The first section addresses the international perspectives of the changing dynamics through the lens of US domestic politics, disengagement plans, China's increasing understanding of the geopolitics of the Abrahamic world. It equally pays enough attention to the attendant implications of this normalisation. The second section of the book explores the reflections of regional (state and non-state) actors, such as Turkey, Iran, Syria, Pakistan, and Hezbollah, and the catalysing effects of this normalisation within and beyond the region. The book is a rich resource for scholars of regional and international relations, in particular Middle East studies. It provides useful reading material for both undergraduate and graduate students of Political Science, think tanks, diplomats, and IR experts and policy analysts, who are desirous of having rich theoretical and empirical underpinnings of unfolding realities in the larger Middle East.";"Singapore : Palgrave Macmillan, 2024 ";"Part I: International Perspectives-- Part II.

286885;"Gulf ideological dynamics : exploring the quest for unity and discord / ";;"The Gulf ideological system is a set of interconnected beliefs and principles governing the region's political, economic, social, and cultural spheres. It combines various ideologies, including religious, nationalist, tribal, and pan-Islamic ideologies. It is shaped by a combination of historical, cultural, and socio-economic factors. Political alliances, economic shifts, social movements, and cultural exchanges contribute to its transformation. Economics plays a significant role in shaping Gulf ideologies. The region's wealth, derived from oil and gas reserves, has driven rapid economic development and created distinct economic ideologies within the Gulf. The social dimension of the Gulf ideological system is shaped by religion, culture, and societal norms. Islam influences various aspects of social life, contributing to conservative social ideologies in some Gulf countries. This book, ""Gulf Ideological Dynamics"", delves into the intricate web of political, economic, social, and cultural forces shaping the Gulf region. Authored by the GEW Reports & Analyses Team under the expert guidance of Dr. Hichem Karoui, this scholarly work offers a comprehensive examination of the complex dynamics driving unity and discord in the Gulf. From analyzing historical tensions to dissecting contemporary challenges, this book provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of Gulf ideologies. With meticulous research and astute observations, it sheds light on the interplay of various factors influencing regional dynamics.

By examining the drivers and challenges surrounding the localization of the defense industry in these states, it seeks to unravel the complex processes and factors that shape this evolving sector. An in-depth analysis of the economic implications of localization constitutes another significant aspect of this book. As the defense industry becomes increasingly localized, it holds the potential to generate substantial economic growth, create high-skilled job opportunities, and foster technological innovation. Scrutinizing the economic dynamics and potential benefits of the defense industry in the GCC states offers valuable insights into their broader efforts towards economic diversification and reducing dependence on hydrocarbon revenues, ultimately facilitating the transition towards knowledge-based economies. Aside from economic considerations, this book also explores the security implications of local defense industry development. As the GCC states endeavor to achieve defense localization, there is potential for enhancing their military capabilities, reducing vulnerabilities, and strengthening their national security posture. Understanding the impact of these developments on regional security dynamics, military strategies, and collaborative defense initiatives is crucial for policymakers, security analysts, and defense officials.";"La Vergne : Global East-West (London), 2024.

286888;"Modern Populism : Weaponizing for Power and Influence / ";"Tripathi, Deepak.";"This book sheds light on modern populism and discusses the link between populism and identity politics against the backdrop of populist leaders asserting the identity of their own group, while maintaining the separation from others. Written by former BBC correspondent and commentator Deepak Tripathi, the book explains how populism has a long history with early discernable origins in the Tsarist Russian Empire and North America in the nineteenth century, spreading to Latin America, Europe, and elsewhere in the following century. The book analyzes various forms of populism, its causes and consequences. It further looks at how industrialization, economic growth, and movement of people led to conditions which contributed to inequalities, fueling populist sentiments and social conflict around the globe. Tripathi concludes that populism has moved from the fringes to the mainstream of politics, and is here to stay, given factors such as growing competition for resources, population increase, climate change, and migration. The book will appeal to students, scholars, and researchers of political science and neighboring disciplines, as well as policy-makers interested in a better understanding of modern populism and its roots. Written in a graceful, informative style, this book explores the rise of populism on the global scene and exposes its dangers.

And one of the triggers for that war would be a nuclear missile inbound toward the United States. Every generation, a journalist has looked deep into the heart of the nuclear military establishment: the technologies, the safeguards, the plans, and the risks. These investigations are vital to how we understand the world we really live in--where one nuclear missile will beget one in return, and where the choreography of the world's end requires massive decisions made on seconds' notice with information that is only as good as the intelligence we have. Pulitzer Prize finalist Annie Jacobsen's Nuclear War: A Scenario explores this ticking-clock scenario, based on dozens of exclusive new interviews with military and civilian experts who have built the weapons, have been privy to the response plans, and have been responsible for those decisions should they have needed to be made. Nuclear War: A Scenario examines the handful of minutes after a nuclear missile launch.

In this book, energy analysts, geopolitical experts and specialists of political economy examine the new energy potential in the Middle East. The particular focus surrounds how the region's access to finance, combined with the new global regulations and considerations of economic development, shape the region's energy transitions overall. The Middle East is revealed to be a key site of new energy production, sharing and transmission as well as technology innovation. At the same time, the authors examine the variables that determine the success in each country and energy source, including the advantages that hydrocarbon producers will have in renewables and transition fuels, and the risk that these might slow down the energy transition overall. In doing so, the book situates the energy transition in the Middle East in a broader context of economic development, financing models, and regulations, and explains how this context interacts with the development of new energy sources.

Today, the UAE projects an image of modernity and prosperity; but before its formation, the emirates endured poverty and political upheaval while the rulers and people navigated the transition from autonomous city-states to modern nation states under informal British rule. This book shows how the Trucial States came to form a sovereign federation, paying particular attention to the role of nationalism and anti-imperialism. Kristi Barnwell demonstrates that the ruling sheikhs of the Gulf Arab rulers in the Gulf strove to create their new state with close ties to Great Britain, which provided technical, military and administrative assistance to the emirates, while also publicly embracing the popular ideologies of anti-imperialism and Arab socialism that were still dominating the political discourse in the Arab world. In the process, she situates the Emirates' modern history in the broader narratives of the history of the Middle East.

Highlighting the various challenges faced by GCC countries, amid the region’s strategic and geopolitical significance, the book examines the Gulf’s influence over global trade routes and its role in maintaining international energy security. The book underscores the vital importance of international cooperation and sound Arab leadership in the face of a growing number of challenges and threats, particularly against the backdrop of external interference in regional issues.

Several regional issues of global significance are explored, including the Iranian crisis and the resultant risks to maritime security amid repeated threats to close the Strait of Hurmuz. In responding to these issues, the book emphasizes the importance of pursuing political action to avoid military conflict in the region, which would result in catastrophic damage to the regional and wider global economy and global security. The book also addresses the transition from oil and gas to renewable energy, focusing on the implications for the GCC. Finally, the balance of international and intra-regional alliances in the Middle East is covered, examining the role of Russia, the US and China in response to the challenges that undermine the security and stability of the Arabian Gulf region.";"Abu Dhabi: The Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research, 2022 ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=284234

287354;"Mission AI :  the new system technology / ";"Sheikh, Haroon.,";"This open access book offers a strategic perspective on AI and the process of embedding it in society. After decades of research, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now entering society at large. Due to its general purpose character, AI will change society in multiple, fundamental and unpredictable ways. Therefore, the Netherlands Scientic Council for Government Policy (WRR) characterizes AI as a system technology: a rare type of technologies that have a systemic impact on society. Earlier system technologies include electricity, the combustion engine and the computer. The history of these technologies provides us with useful insights about what it takes to direct the introduction of AI in society. The WRR identifies five key tasks to structurally work on this process: demystification, contextualisation, engagement, regulation and positioning. By clarifying what AI is (demystification), creating a functional ecosystem (contextualisation), involving diverse stakeholders (engagement), developing directive frameworks (regulation) and engaging internationally (positioning), societies can meaningfully influence how AI settles. Collectively, these activities steer the process of co-development between technology and society, and each representing a different path to safeguard public values. Mission AI - The New System Technology was originally published as an advisory report for the government of the Netherlands. The strategic analysis and the outlined recommendations are, however, relevant to every government and organization that aims to take up 'mission AI' and embed this newest system technology in our world.";"Cham, Switzerland: Springer, 2023 ";"Part I Building blocks: introducing and interpreting AI as a new system technology, similar to electricity and the internal combustion engine.--Introduction.--Chapter 1 Artificial Intelligence: definition and background.--Chapter 2 AI is leaving the lab and entering society.--Chapter 3 AI as a system technology.--Part II Five tasks: discussion of the tasks for embedding AI into society.--Chapter 4 Demystification.--Chapter 5 Contextualization.--Chapter 6 Engagement.--Chapter 7 Regulation.--Chapter 8 Consider AI as a system technology.--Part III Agenda: conclusions and recommendations for AI policy in the Netherlands.--Chapter 9 Policy for AI as a system technology.--Appendix: Examples of AI applications in the Netherlands.

As digital technologies have become ever more ingrained in society, Media Use in Digital Everyday Life asks how our relationship with media has changed. After the proliferation of smartphones, social media and ubiquitous connectivity, what has happened to the ways we navigate across social domains and structure our daily routines? Filling a gap between classic discussions on everyday media use and recent studies of emergent technologies, this book untangles how media become meaningful to us in the everyday, connecting us to communities and publics. With analyses of media use in an ordinary day, as part of life transitions and in times of disruption, Ytre-Arne provides a comprehensive framework for studies of everyday media use, considering dilemmas of technological transformations and recent crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Media Use in Digital Everyday Life offers empirical, methodological and theoretical insight, building on extensive qualitative research and taking a cross-media perspective. Through the conceptual approaches of media repertoires and public connection, the book situates communication and changing media use in everyday contexts, showing how our more digital everyday lives intensify communicative dilemmas. Written in an accessible tone, Media Use in Digital Everyday Life will appeal to readers interested in digital media, and to students and scholars of audiences, datafication, journalism and digital platforms.

Welcome to the Metaverse, an online virtual reality that is expected to add billions to the global economy. The Metaverse offers a new type of virtual economy with practically endless business opportunities. The question is how to prevent these opportunities from being abused to commit money laundering and finance terrorism (MLFT). This book explores the current European Union legislation designed to prevent MLFT in connection with the Metaverse. It analyses the legislation in relation to the three traditional stages of MLFT: placement, layering and integration. Furthermore, some additional risks specific to the Metaverse are discussed, such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and the high level of anonymity. The book concludes that the current legislation is not suitable for facing the new challenges of the Metaverse. In turn, the book puts forward a novel approach to regulating and enforcing MLFT legislation: using a system of smart assets equipped with AI to prevent and detect MLFT. In addition, it makes recommendations on how to improve the legal framework with regard to the new challenges arising from the Metaverse. Particular attention is given to creating a legal framework that incorporates the use of smart assets and the Internet of Things, in order to provide a safe environment for potential users and society. With a solid background in financial law and technology, the author successfully creates a novel system of regulation and enforcement that is based on the use of automatic enforcement, whilst keeping sufficient legal safeguards in place for potential Metaverse users. This book will be of interest to anyone interested in the Metaverse.

As China's preeminent non-governmental think tank, the Center for China and Globalization (CCG) has invited 30 leading figures from the global think tank community to sift through the myriad layers of multilateralism and global governance and provide a contextual analysis of major themes both from a theoretical and practical perspective that focus on China in detail, but also examine the world as a whole. Think tanks are essential in analyzing current trends and providing potential solutions that aid governments, international organizations and business in finding solutions that are beneficial to all. As a key source of innovative ideas, they have become even more valuable today as the pace of change accelerates, geopolitical complexity increases and the world has to deal with global crises that no country can address on their own. A common, central theme through all of the 25 essays in this book is the need for a more universal, inclusive and multilateral approach to reforming global governance.

Within this, it highlights four key debates that encapsulate the complexities and paradoxes of cyber security politics from a Western perspective - how much political influence states can achieve via cyber operations and what context factors condition the (limited) strategic utility of such operations; the role of emerging digital technologies and how the dynamics of the tech innovation process reinforce the fragmentation of the governance space; how states attempt to uphold stability in cyberspace and, more generally, in their strategic relations; and how the shared responsibility of state, economy, and society for cyber security continues to be re-negotiated in an increasingly trans-sectoral and transnational governance space.

Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more.    Since the end of the Cold War, globalization--the process and the idea--has been reshaping the world. Global studies scholarship has emerged to make sense of the transnational manifestations of globalization: economic, social, cultural, ideological, technological, environmental, and postcolonial. But a series of crises in the first two decades of the twenty-first century has put the neoliberal globalization system of the 1990s under severe strain.     Are we witnessing a turn toward ""deglobalization,"" intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine or a moment of ""reglobalization,"" spearheaded by digital technology?

The leadership and legacy of al-Haq, from its origins in Palestine to its international impact     Established in Ramallah in 1979, al-Haq was the first Palestinian human rights organization and one of the first such organizations in the Arab world. This inside history explores how al-Haq initiated methodologies in law and practice that were ahead of its time and that proved foundational for many strands of today's human rights work in Palestine and elsewhere. Lynn Welchman looks at both al-Haq's history and legacy to explore such questions as: Why would one set up a human rights organization under military occupation? How would one go about promoting the rule of law in a Palestinian society deleteriously served by the law and with every reason to distrust those charged with implementing its protections? How would one work to educate overseas allies and activate international law in defense of Palestinian rights? This revelatory story speaks to the practice of local human rights organizations and their impact on international groups.";"Berkeley : University of California Press, 2021.

Learn more at www.luminosoa.org.    The quest for an inclusive and independent state has been at the center of the Palestinian national struggle for a very long time. This book critically explores the meaning of Palestinian statehood and the challenges that face alternative models to it. Giving prominence to a young set of diverse Palestinian scholars, this groundbreaking book shows how notions of citizenship, sovereignty, and nationhood are being rethought within the broader context of decolonization. Bringing forth critical and multifaceted engagements with what modern Palestinian self-determination entails, Rethinking Statehood sets the terms of debate for the future of Palestine beyond partition.";"Berkeley : University of California Press, 2021.

287537;"Preparing for Hybrid Threats to Security : Collaborative Preparedness and Response /";"Borch, Odd Jarl.";"This book examines hybrid threats within the broader context of a security crisis in Europe. As geopolitical tensions increase and great power rivalries intensify, can states protect their communities? While conventional wars are fought, parallel battles take place by more subtle and non-violent means. This multi-disciplinary book examines how hybrid threats undermine political governance and social stability in liberal democracies, covering aggressors, targeted states and victimized communities. It seeks to address how aggressor states undermine liberal democracies under the threshold of conflict, and the role played by hybrid threats as aggressor states prepare for full-scale war. The chapters also explore how liberal democracies organize and interact to detect hybrid threats, arguing that, in order to increase resilience, politicians and government agencies must involve the private sector and citizens in threat-reduction policies. The analysis builds upon the latest research in the international crisis management literature. This book will be of interest to students of security studies, hybrid warfare, defence studies and International Relations, as well as professional practitioners.

This open access Pivot is a timely exploration of some of the challenges and prospects related to digital sustainability from two main perspectives: how digital technologies can be used and maintained in a way that is environmentally sustainable over the long term (greening of digital technologies), and how digital technologies can be used to address climate change and improve environmental and sustainability outcomes (greening by digital technologies). The chapters included in this book are designed to provide some key definitions and concepts related to digital sustainability and its evolution, and more detailed insights on some of the key priority areas outlined in the European Green Deal, namely energy, mobility, buildings, food and the circular economy. A critical review of these topics will summarise and present different perspectives that challenge old assumptions and highlight emerging trends and possibilities for digital sustainability. Industry and society face significant challenges in the twin transition to digital and green transformation, not least of which is the need to balance investment in digital technologies with environmental sustainability. This open-access book can serve as a primer for scholars, policymakers, and enterprise decision-makers, providing insights on navigating innovation ecosystems to support both green and digital objectives.";"Cham, Switzerland : Palgrave Macmillan,  2024 ";"Chapter 1 : Digital Sustainability.--Chapter 2 : Green IT: The evolution of environmental concerns within ICT policy, research and practice.--Chapter 3 : Interacting digital and sustainability transformation through artificial intelligence.--Chapter 4 : Digital transformation and AI in energy systems.--Chapter 5 : From concrete jungles to smart cities and digital towns.--Chapter 6 : Smart farming technologies and sustainability.--Chapter 7 : Digital technologies for sustainable product management in circular economy.

The author identifies critical factors for the successful implementation and usage of such platforms, including barriers which may be related, for example, to the absence of sufficient knowledge about digital technology platforms or the inability to obtain a sufficient amount of financial resources. Business Models and Digital Technology Platforms develops a comprehensive model of DTPs based on empirical research in Poland. It demonstrates how platforms influence changes in the operations of companies, their level of competitiveness, the consumer's role in the process of joint development of innovations, and the consumer's experience as well as implications of the use of AI for the autonomy of DTPs. The book offers a unique, holistic understanding of the complexities involved and showcases their role within digital business.

However, despite receiving increased attention as philosophers become more interested in mathematical and computational methods, the philosophy and science of modeling remains a relatively under-explored topic. The Routledge Handbook of Philosophy of Scientific Modeling is an outstanding reference source and guide to this fast-growing area and is the first volume of its kind. Comprised of 40 specially commissioned chapters by an international team of contributors, the Handbook is organized into five clear parts: Historical and General Perspectives Philosophical Accounts of Modeling Methodological Aspects: Model Construction, Evaluation and Calibration Related Topics Modeling in the Wild. Within these parts a diverse range of topics are discussed, including historical perspectives on modeling, representation, idealization, fictional models, data models, robustness, computer simulation, experiments, modalities, measurement, interdisciplinary approaches, models and values, 3D models, game theory, and climate and biological modeling. The Routledge Handbook of Philosophy of Scientific Modeling is essential reading for students and scholars of philosophy of science, formal epistemology, and philosophy of social science.

287552;"Circular economy realities : critical perspectives on sustainability /";;"""This book addresses the realities of the circular economy, a resource efficiency concept that has risen to global prominence in academic, policy and business circles over the last decade. Considered an approach to sustainable growth, the volume critically analyses how sustainable emerging applications of a circular economy are in practice. The book stems from an international, interdisciplinary project exploring the discourses, policies, implementation, and impacts of the circular economy across public, private and third sector accounts. It draws on a wide range of case studies, from the UK, Portugal, Austria, Italy, Netherlands, France, Chile, China, Nigeria, Taiwan and Vietnam, highlighting how experiences both shaped and were shaped by the places in which they were happening. It provides a guide to researching a complex phenomenon such as a circular economy, which involves both collaboration and competition between multiple stakeholders across different sectors and places. Synthesising the multiple perspectives employed in the project, the book makes recommendations for circular economy implementation in different contexts, including the assessment of sustainability implications, whilst indicating the limited potential for circular economy activity to bring social and economic benefits without explicit motivation for those to happen. Benefitting from extensive empirical research, this critical assessment of sustainability in the context of the circular economy will appeal to a broad readership of academics, upper-level students, practitioners and policy-makers in sustainable development, business, economics, geography, sociology and environmental engineering""--";"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY : Routledge, 2024.

Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more.    In a world increasingly shaped by displacement and migration, refuge is both a coveted right and an elusive promise for millions. While conventionally understood as legal protection, it also transcends judicial definitions. In Lived Refuge, Vinh Nguyen reconceptualizes refuge as an ongoing affective experience and lived relation rather than a fixed category with legitimacy derived from the state.     Focusing on Southeast Asian diasporas in the wake of the Vietnam War, Nguyen examines three affective experiences--gratitude, resentment, and resilience--to reveal the actively lived dimensions of refuge. Through multifaceted analyses of literary and cultural productions, Nguyen argues that the meaning of refuge emerges from how displaced people negotiate the kinds of safety and protection that are offered to (and withheld from) them. In so doing, he lays the framework for an original and compelling understanding of contemporary refugee subjectivity.";"Berkeley : University of California Press, 2023.

بعد سبعين عاما من النضالات الشاقة، أخذت الصين طريقها بثبات إلى بناء دولة قوية تحت قياد الحزب الشيوعي الصيني، بينما تشهد الدول العربية تغيرات كبيرة، وتخطط إستراتيجيات التنمية الجديدة المناسبة لأحوالها بعد أن جربت محاولات عديدة. حاليا، تقف الدول العربية في مفترق طرق للتنمية في تاريخها، لذا، يتسم التعاون الإستراتيجي بين الصين والدول العربية بأهمية خاصة ومحتويات متزايدة.

الصين والدول العربية من الدولة النامية، وتحتل مساحة أراضي الطرفين سدس مساحة الأرض في العالم، ويمثل عدد السكان فيهما حوالي ربع إجمالي سكان العالم، ويحتل الحجم الاقتصادي لهما ثمن إجمالي حجم الاقتصاد العالمي. على الرغم من أن الصين والدول العربية تختلف من حيث الموارد الطبيعية، ومستويات التنمية، فإن كلا الطرفين في مرحلة هامة من التنمية، ويحمل مهمة مشتركة لتحقيق نهضة الأمة وازدهار الوطن. ليس بين الطرفين عداوات تاريخية، بل يتمتعان بصداقة حميمة وأساس جيد للتعاون. تعمل الصين كأكبر دولة نامية، والدول العربية كمجموعة مهمة من الدول النامية، على تبادل خبرات التنمية وتعزيز التعاون في تحقيق التنمية المشتركة، كما يبذل الطرفان جهودهما في تعزيز الأمن الإقليمي ويتعاونان معا لبناء العلاقة الدولية الجديدة، مما يلعب دورا هاما في تعزيز السلام والتنمية الإقليمية والعالمية.";"عمان، الأردن : المنهل للنشر الإلكتروني، 2018.

287837;"Ai in Business and Economics / ";;"Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have generated intense interest and debate about their potential to reshape industries, labour markets and socio-economic structures. This volume presents a collection of academic papers stemming from ""The Economic Perspective of Artificial Intelligence"" (EPEAI) conference held at the Ruhr West University of Applied Sciences in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany, in March 2023. AI in Business and Economics discusses topics as varied as marketing, accounting, reporting, business narratives, forecasting, generational differences in attitudes, economic policy - all in the context of exploring the multifaceted intersection of economics and artificial intelligence. It navigates through the fog caused by the heterogeneity of diverse AI applications and methodologies by examining artificial intelligence from an economic perspective. In doing so, it becomes clear that the implementation of a broad range of AI technologies in companies has just begun. Businesses, employees, and policy makers will soon have to adapt to the fast-paced advancements in artificial intelligence, ensuring they become and remain competitive, ethical, and forward-thinking in a changing global landscape.

287843;"European actorness in a shifting geopolitical order : European strategic autonomy through differentiated integration /";"Rieker, Pernille,";"""The successive crises the EU has undergone, notably with the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have highlighted dramatically how European security includes while spans well beyond defence. Picking up from this cue, this book masterfully expands the notion of European strategic autonomy across different areas while highlighting its fundamental compatibility with the goal of building stronger partnerships beyond the EU's borders."" - Nathalie Tocci, director at IAI in Rome ""European Actorness in a Shifting Geopolitical Context is a timely and thought-provoking contribution to the discourse on European strategic autonomy. Rieker and Giske go beyond conventional notions of defence to highlight the pressing need to address the growing risk of hybrid threats. With meticulous research and a nuanced understanding of contemporary debates on European integration and security, this volume presents a comprehensive approach to fleshing out European strategic autonomy. A must-read for policymakers, academic experts and anyone interested in understanding Europe's evolving role on the international stage."" - Mark Leonard, director of ECFR ""Rieker and Giske provide an innovative analysis of how external differentiation can help improve EU actorness and security. This is the first study that systematically brings together two core issues in European integration: external differentiation and strategic autonomy. Building on a broad empirical basis, the book makes an important contribution to current political and academic discussions on Europe's foreign and security policy."" - Frank Schimmelfennig, Professor, ETH Zurich This is an open access book. Over the past decade, the global geopolitical context has changed significantly, with a geopolitical power shift and a more assertive Russia and China. With the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, European security has been put on high alert. The implications of the Russian military invasion are many and difficult to grasp in full. But the need for greater European strategic autonomy appears increasingly evident. But how can this be achieved in the short run? A common answer to this question is that it is impossible or that this can only be achieved in the long run, if at all. The aim of this book is to present a different perspective. It aims at showing that it should be possible to make the most out of the current European system if we adjust our understanding of how it works. The book argues that strategic autonomy may be reached-also in the short run-if differentiated integration (DI) is seen as an asset rather than a challenge. While the EU remains the core in such a system (together with NATO in the military domain), there is a multitude of other (bilateral and minilateral) regional and sub-regional integration processes that need to be considered to get the full idea of how a more differentiated European strategic autonomy can be achieved. This book starts by presenting a theoretical framework for how to study European actorness beyond the EU (ch.2), then this framework is applied both to understand Europe as a global actor (ch. 3), Europe as an actor in security and defence (ch. 4) and Europe as a regional actor (ch. 5). Pernille Rieker holds a position as a research professor at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI) and a part-time full professor at the Inland University College (INN). Rieker is part of NUPI's research group on security and defence and is responsible for NUPI's Center for European Studies (NCE).

Almost half of the respondents argued that they turn to Wikipedia to learn about history and acquire a historical understanding of the past. Wikipedia was ranked higher than other historical activities, such as “Historic site visit,” “Museum visit,” “Genealogy work,” “Social media,” “Podcast/radio program,” “History lecture,” and “History-related video game.” These findings combined with the appropriation of Wikipedia’s corpus by ChatGPT and Wikipedia’s partnership with the most central search engine in the digital world, Google, and other digital assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, make clear how crucial the role of Wikipedia in how the public learns about history and makes sense of the past is.

But how is historical knowledge produced on Wikipedia? How do Wikipedia editors engage with historical events of the past and transform the past into historical knowledge? Why do they decide to contribute to the production of history? By placing Wikipedia editors at the center of research inquiry and using multiple methodologies and different kinds of data, this book explores how historical knowledge is produced in one of the most central digital communities of knowledge, Wikipedia.";"Boston : De Gruyter Oldenbourg, 2024.

287870;"Epistemic rights in the era of digital disruption / ";;"This open-access volume argues that in a functioning democracy, citizens should be equally capable of making informed choices about matters of social importance. This includes citizens accessing all relevant information and knowledge necessary for informed will formation. In today's complex era of digital disruption, it is not enough to simply speak about communication or even digital rights. The starting point for this volume is the need for 'epistemic equality'. The contributors seek to showcase the history and diversity of current debates around communication and digital rights, as precursors for the need for epistemic rights; both as a theoretical concept and an empirically assessed benchmark. The book highlights scholarship via academic case studies from around the world to feature different issues and methodological approaches, as well as similarities in academic and policy challenges across the globe. The goal is to provide an overview of issues that depict challenges to epistemic rights, extract both academic and applied policy implications of different approaches, and end with a set of recommendations for advancing policy-relevant scholarship on epistemic rights. This volume is intended as the first holistic response to an urgent need to address epistemic rights of communication as a central public policy issue, as an academic analytical concept, as well as a central theme for informed public debate. This book is open-access, meaning you have free and unlimited access.

288234;"Digital inclusion : international policy and research /";;"This collection presents policy and research that addresses digital inequalities, access, and skills, from multiple international perspectives. With a special focus on the impact of the COVID-19, the collection is based on the 2021 Digital Inclusion, Policy and Research Conference, with chapters from both academia and civic organizations. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed citizens relationship with digital technologies for the foreseeable future. Many peoples main channels of communication were transferred to digital services, platforms, and apps. Everything went online: our families, friends, partners, health, work, news, politics, culture, arts and protesting. Yet access to digital technologies remained highly unequal. This brought digital inclusion policy and research to the fore, highlighting to policymakers and the public the hidden challenges and impacts of digital exclusion and inequalities. The cutting-edge volume offers research findings and policy case studies that explore digital inclusion from the provision of basic access to digital, via education and digital literacy, and on to issues of gender and technology. Case studies are drawn from varied sources including the UK, Australia, South America, and Eastern Europe, providing a valuable resource in the pursuit of social equity and justice.

288235;"Knowledge and digital technology / ";;"This open access book explores the multifaceted interplay of technology, knowledge, and place. While digital technology is increasingly influencing our way of knowing, conversely it is itself the consequence of human creativity and local social interaction. Part I analyzes how digital technologies transform markets through artificial intelligence and decentralized blockchain models. Its contributions discuss novel governance mechanisms, including the responsible use and analysis of big data. Part II illustrates various ways in which technology supports humanity, be it algorithms supporting complex decision-making processes or the use of robotics in care services. The chapters highlight that technology's efficiency and potential rely on social norms and human capital. Finally, Part III shows that digitization is generating vibrant entrepreneurship, reflected in geographically clustered urban scale-up economies, as well as opening up new ways for people to connect with one another, organize civic engagement and enable new forms of labor. The book offers theoretical reflections as well as empirical cases from the United States, Canada, Japan, South Africa, and Europe.

288236;"Unequal security : welfare, crime and social inequality /";;"""We live in an age of insecurity. The Global Financial Crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the climate crisis are just the most evident examples of shocks that have increased the level of insecurity among elites and citizens in recent years. And yet there is ample evidence that insecurity is not equally distributed across populations. Bringing together disciplines such as political science, criminology, sociology, and anthropology and combining quantitative and qualitative studies from a wide range of rich and middle-income countries, this collection presents a new framework for exploring the two key social challenges of our times - insecurity and inequality - together. The volume analyses the nature, causes and distribution of subjective insecurities and how various actors use or respond to unequal security. The essays cover a host of themes including the unequal spatial distribution of (in)security, unequal access to security provision in relation to crime and welfare, the impact of insecurity on political attitudes, as well as policy responses and the political exploitation of insecurity. An important contribution to debates across several social scientific disciplines as well as current public debate on insecurity and politics, the volume will be of great interest to scholars and researchers of criminology, social policy, peace and conflict studies, politics and international relations, sociology, development studies and economics. It will also be of interest to policy-makers and government think tanks""--";"Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY : Routledge, 2025.

Not only the natural sciences, but also the social sciences and the humanities seem to be increasingly affected by current approaches of subsymbolic AI, which master problems of quality (fuzziness, uncertainty) in a hitherto unknown way. But what are the conditions, implications, and effects of these (potential) epistemic transformations and how must research on AI be configured to address them adequately?";"Bielefeld : transcript Verlag, 2024.

288304;"Algorithmic Regimes : Methods, Interactions, and Politics /";"Jarke, Juliane.";"Algorithms have risen to become one, if not the central technology for producing, circulating, and evaluating knowledge in multiple societal arenas. In this book, scholars from the social sciences, humanities, and computer science argue that this shift has, and will continue to have, profound implications for how knowledge is produced and what and whose knowledge is valued and deemed valid. To attend to this fundamental change, the authors propose the concept of algorithmic regimes and demonstrate how they transform the epistemological, methodological, and political foundations of knowledge production, sensemaking, and decision-making in contemporary societies. Across sixteen chapters, the volume offers a diverse collection of contributions along three perspectives on algorithmic regimes: the methods necessary to research and design algorithmic regimes, the ways in which algorithmic regimes reconfigure sociotechnical interactions, and the politics engrained in algorithmic regimes.";"Amsterdam : Amsterdam University Press, 2024.

288303;"Digital Media, Denunciation and Shaming : The Court of Public Opinion /";"Trottier, Daniel,";"This book offers a common set of concepts to help make sense of online shaming practices, accounting for instances of discrimination and injury that morally divide readers and at times risk unjust and disproportionate harm to those under scrutiny. Digital media denunciation has become a primary form of expression and entertainment across media environments, with new socially desirable forms of accountability under movements such as #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter addressing longstanding forms of systematic and interpersonal abuse. Building on recent scholarship on shaming, surveillance and denunciation in fixed contexts, this study generates a cross-contextual and multi-actor account of practices like 'cancel culture', 'doxing' and 'status degradation ceremonies'. It addresses instances of moral ambivalence by discussing how digital shaming becomes normalised and embedded across socio-cultural and institutional settings. The authors establish key actors and practices in online denunciations of individuals in a range of cases and contexts, including responses to COVID-19, political polarisation, and social justice movements, as well as more local and quotidian circumstances. They draw from empirical data including interviews with nearly 100 individuals targeted by mediated shaming and/or involved in these practices, as well as ethnographic observations of digital vigilantism and discourse analysis of press coverage and online comments relating to online shaming. Diverse applications and contexts, including China, the UK, Russia, and Central Asia, are considered, advancing an ambivalent understanding of media and denunciation that reconciles progressive and regressive practices, as well as celebratory and critical accounts of these practices. This book is recommended reading for advanced students and researchers of online visibility and harm across media studies, cultural studies and sociology.";"Abindon, Oxon ; New York, New York : Routledge, [2025] ";" Table of Contents -- Chapter 1.

288302;"Digital China : Creativity and Community in the Sinocybersphere /";"Imbach, Jessica.";"Over the past decade, digital technologies have profoundly reshaped the Chinese cultural landscape. With a focus on the creative agency of new media and online communities, this volume examines this development through the notion of the Sinocybersphere - the networked spaces across the globe that not only operate on the Chinese script, but also imaginatively negotiate the meanings of Chinese culture in the digital age. Instead of asking what makes the internet or new media ""Chinese,"" the chapters situate contemporary entanglements of cultural and digital practices within specific historical, social, and discursive contexts. Covering topics as diverse as live-streaming, AI poetry, online literature, poetry memes, cyberpunk fiction, virtual art exhibitions, cooking videos, censorship, and viral translations, the collection as a whole not only engages with a wide range of Chinese new media phenomena, but also demonstrates their relevance to our understanding of contemporary digital culture.";"Amsterdam : Amsterdam University Press, 2024.

288301;"Reflections on the Russia-Ukraine War / ";"Rothman, Maarten.";"The Russia-Ukraine war is a multifaceted beast. It ranges from fighting on the ground to high diplomacy, from domestic anti-war protests to international weapon supplies, from justification through sham referenda to coercion via economic sabotage, and from operational misdirection to covering up war crimes. There are close connections between these facets: the collapse of a front leads to the discovery of mass graves; the delivery of weapon systems depends on Zelensky's appeal to the international community; sham referenda followed by annexation enable accusations of unwillingly mobilized soldiers who refuse to defend the motherland.The volume sheds light on the Russia-Ukraine war, exploring this multitude of facets and their interconnections. Bringing together the expertise of our colleagues at the Netherlands Defense Academy (NLDA) allows us to adopt a distinctively interdisciplinary approach, offering uniquely comprehensive and timely reflections on this armed conflict. The 27 chapters in this volume are centered around five themes. The first section covers historical and contemporary narratives, intelligence, digital technologies, and communication strategies. The second provides in-depth analyses of the operational aspects of the war, including warfighting on land, at sea, in the air, as well as in the space and cyber domains. The third section on international involvement covers topics such as sanctions, burden sharing, arms support and implications of the war on international institutions and the world order. The fourth provides analyses of the normative framework that applies to the Russia-Ukraine war. Finally, the fifth section deals with the way armed forces can transform their organizations and learn from this war, and concludes with questions on how and when the Russia-Ukriane war might end.";"Amsterdam : Amsterdam University Press, 2024.

288298;"Urban Terrorism in Contemporary Europe : Remembering, Imagining and Anticipating Violence /";"Karcher, Katharina.";"This open access book sheds light on collective practices of remembering, imagining and anticipating in relation to recent acts of urban terrorism in Europe. Analysing a range of personal and collective responses to urban terrorism in contemporary Europe, this book shows that current debates on this issue are shaped by multiple co-existing and intersecting memories of political violence in the past. Moreover, despite public declarations of unity and solidarity, collective memories of urban terror in contemporary Europe are far from consensual - memory can be both a catalyst for and an impediment to social and political change. Drawing on case studies from a range of European countries and creative responses by survivors, artists, and poets, this interdisciplinary volume introduces readers to key methods (e.g. discourse analysis and (auto-)ethnography) and concepts (e.g. Lieux de Mémoire and 'grassroots memorials') for the study of the memoralization of terror attacks.";"Cham : Springer International Publishing AG, 2024.

288297;"Cold War Europe : A Space of Communication /";"Nanz, Tobias.";"The Cold War is often stereotypically depicted as a period of complete separation between Eastern and Western Europe, a time of little communication and exchange between what is often called the ""Eastern bloc"" and the capitalist West . European integration, it is thought, was a Western project based on exclusively Western ideas. This edited volume aims to debunk this stereotype. It provides evidence for the numerous media and individuals that contributed to the circulation and exchange of ideas across the ideological divide of the Iron Curtain. The essays in this volume discuss the official and unofficial channels of communication between the Eastern bloc and the West as well as the complex networks of transmission and reception that enabled the exchange of ideas between the two. The first part of the volume examines the communication infrastructure of the Cold War and the role of then available communication technologies. The second hones in on how different media channels, and the radio in particular, were used to form and transmit ideas between East and West, whereas the third and final part looks at how individual artists and literary authors made their voices heard across the Iron Curtain.";"Berlin/Boston : Walter de Gruyter GmbH, 2024.

288321;"Soft power and great-power competition : shifting sands in the balance of power between the United States and China /";"Nye, Joseph S.,";"This open access book consists of essays selected from Joseph S. Nye, Jr.'s last three decades of writing and illustrate a variety of perspectives on the nature of power, the role of the United States in the world and US-China relations. Through this collection, it is hoped that readers will gain a better understanding of today's global environment and find that while great power competition may be inevitable in a world as centers of power shift, cooperating to address transnational challenges can be a positive sum game. The contents of this book are divided into four main parts. Part One discusses the origins and political progress of the concept of ""Soft Power"". Part Two explores soft power in the American experience, its sources and interaction with US foreign policy, as well as its ebb and flow in the age of Obama, Trump and Biden. Part Three examines the rise of and the opportunities and difficulties for Chinese soft power, focusing on China's investment in soft power and how this demonstrates its commitment to a peaceful rise. However, it also addresses the question of how can China get ""smart"" on how it uses soft power. Part Four provides a bird's-eye view of power shifts in the 21st century and the interactions between the US as an established power and China as a rising power, while also reassuring readers that Thucydidean fears are unnecessary and a Cold War is avoidable. Both countries have to realize that some forms of power must be exercised with others, not over others, the development of soft power need not be a zero-sum game. Ultimately, the US-China relationship is a ""cooperative rivalry"" where a successful strategy of ""smart competition"" is necessary and cooperation on transnational challenges like climate change, pandemics, cyberterrorism and nuclear proliferation, will serve to benefit not only China and the US, but the world as a whole";"Singapore : Springer, 2023 ";"Soft Power -- The Great Power Shift -- The Limits of Soft Power -- State Smart Power Strategies -- Understanding 21st Century Power Shifts -- Soft power: the Origins and Political Progress of a Concept -- What Is a Moral Foreign Policy? -- Soft Power and American Foreign Policy -- Get Smart: Combining Hard and Soft Power -- Obama the Pragmatist -- American Soft Power in the Age of Trump -- Trump's Effect on US Foreign Policy -- Can Joe Biden's America Be Trusted? -- After the Liberal International Order -- As China Rises, Must Others Bow? -- The Rise of China's Soft Power -- Hard Decisions on Soft Power: Opportunities and Difficulties for Chinese Soft Power -- Xi Jinping's Marco Polo Strategy -- China's Soft and Sharp Power -- Perspectives for a China Strategy -- The 'Nye Report': Six Years Later -- The Dollar and the Dragon -- Is China Overtaking America? -- The Financial Crisis and US-China Misperceptions -- Work With China, Don't Contain It -- The Future of U.S -- China Relations -- The Kindleberger Trap -- The Cooperative Rivalry of US-China Relations -- The Future of U.S.-China Relations After Buenos Aires -- For the US and China, Interdependence is a Double-Edged Sword -- Cold War with China is Avoidable -- The Logic of US-China Competition  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288321

288389;"Automation in Communication : The Ideological Implications of Language Machines /";"Wee, Lionel,";"By drawing on multiple examples from healthcare, religion, service encounters and poetry, Lionel Wee presents rich insights into the use of automation in communication through a posthumanist lens. As communication becomes increasingly automated, the use of automation creates significant conceptual challenges for ideologies about language, beliefs about the nature of language, as well as assumptions about the roles that interpretation, anthropomorphism, and folk theories of mind play when language is used in communication. This book unravels the ideological implications of automation in communication and provides a new theoretical ground to address the major issues raised by automation. Wee discusses the importance of thinking carefully about how we identify and distinguish the roles of speaker and hearer. He also argues that we re-evaluate our understanding of the relationship between language and community. This book will be vital to students interested in studying the intersections of AI, language and communication, as well as researchers working in communication studies, linguistics and the broader sociology of language in the age of technological change""--";"London ; New York : Routledge, [2025] ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=288389

288384;"Arrivals and Departures : The Human Relationship with Changing Biodiversity /";;"This book explores the human relationship to changing biodiversity by bringing together multidisciplinary insights into human-nature relations from the humanities. New animal and plant species arrive and previously existing ones may disappear. However, the historical and social perspectives of the changes have been understudied so far. This book approaches the human relationship with changing biodiversity from three different angles: belonging and non-belonging, emotions, and environmental policy. The question of belonging and non-belonging is crucial when it comes to changing biodiversity. The authors ask who decides where species can move and live and when invasive becomes native. Similarly, emotions have a big role in human-nature relations. The book shows why we grieve the loss of some species and hate some other species, and how our emotions change over time. The writers also aim to show how environmental policies, or the practice of governing species, are affected by societal discussion, emotions, scientific research, and topical concepts as well as how these policies shape biodiversity and our perceptions of different species. The authors provide fresh insights into human-nature relations and explain why we need multidisciplinary approaches in order to fully understand their complexity.";"Berlin/Boston : Walter de Gruyter GmbH, 2024.

It also offers an innovative perspective on some of the key debates in childhood studies, bringing together and relating the different aspects of childhood through a generational lens. Authors from different countries follow young children as they grow up and learn how to become civilized in institutions in contemporary society, discussing how from one generation to the next they learn from adults and their peers an enormous social fund of knowledge about their world";"Cham : Palgrave Macmillan, 2024 ";"Chapter1: Introduction -- Chapter2: Sociology of Early Childhood - why we need child psychoanalysis -- Chapter3: Early Childhood Education in Brazil: Interdependent relationships between young children and adults -- Chapter4: Bringing Norbert Elias to school: education and the civilising process -- Chapter5: Banal nationalism for babies:the early transmission of national habitus to children in the family -- Chapter6: Changes in play and playgrounds within recent informalising and reformalising cycles of parent-child relationships (1950-2020) -- Chapter7: Young People's Use of School-Based Banter Mark Mierzwinski (York St John University) Philippa Velija (University of Roehampton) -- Chapter8: Childhood figurations and processes of social inequality in Brazil -- Chapter9: Down Mom!

288679;"Political ecologies of the far right : fanning the flames /";;"The edited volume Political ecologies of the far right engages with the alarming convergence of far-right thinking and the ecological crisis in contemporary society. Growing out of the first international conference on political ecologies of the far right, the volume gathers crucial insights from authorities in the field as well as promising early career researchers. With cases ranging from ethnographical accounts of fossil fuel populist protest, historical analysis of the evangelical support for fossil fuels to interrogations of the settler colonial identities and material conditions defended by far-right actors around the world, the book provides scholars, students and activists with ways to understand and counter these developments.

288680;"The Trump carnival : populism, transgression and the far right /";"Gaufman, Elizaveta,";"Donald Trump's campaign and presidency represented a radical departure from political norms that are often classified by media and researchers as 'populist'. Instead, this book theorizes Trump's campaign and presidency with reference to Mikhail Bakhtin's ""carnival"" - a medieval festival of transgression, ridicule, and renewal. In this book, Lisa Gaufman and Bharath Ganesh provide a closer insight into the Trump Carnival, developing interdisciplinary perspectives on populism, misogyny, misinformation, and far-right vernacular culture. Building on the idea of the carnivalesque, this book focuses on the laughing culture of the Trump campaigns and presidency that vilified minorities, disparaged women, and ultimately emboldened the far right. Bringing Bakhtin into dialogue with key developments in contemporary politics, this book is a must-read for anyone interested in the Trump phenomenon, American politics, and populism.";"Berlin ; Boston : De Gruyter, 2024 ";"Populism and transgression -- Carnival as theory and methodology -- Trump's digital carnival : Media and multidirectional discourse -- Displaced abjection -- Laughing culture -- Misogyny -- Sex and materiality.

288695;"Qatar's nation branding and soft power : exploring the effects on national identity and international stance /";"Al-Tamimi, Nawaf,";"This open access book examines how creating a national brand assisted Qatar in absorbing the shock and awe following the outburst of the crisis with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates in May 2017. The authors discuss the country's diplomatic performance, which was characterized by five main factors that helped Qatar to deal with the crisis successfully. These factors include the failure of the element of surprise, years of building Qatar's national brand, Qatar's arsenal of soft power, international alliances, and the opponents' quandary. This book further scrutinizes Qatar's role in the region and all questions related to this role through the lenses of its nation brand. The book provides explanations for the success of Qatar in absorbing the ""shock and awe"" in the early stage of the last Gulf crisis, presenting various arguments on how establishing a nation brand helped Qatar to deal with the crisis successfully. The book follows an original approach that views the Qatari case from a scientific perspective, investigating the art of nation branding. It will appeal to students, researchers, and scholars of international relations, psychology, political science, and journalism, as well as policy-makers interested in a better understanding of soft power, nation branding, Middle East studies, and diplomacy";"Cham : Springer, 2023 ";"Chapter 1.

288696;"From Electronic to Mobile Government : The Development of Digital Public Services /";"Homburg, Vincent.";"The open access book combines insights from policy sciences (backgrounds of cross-border coordination challenges), design science (development of architectures for mobile services), information ethics (privacy and security of e-government services in international arenas) and business studies (changes in existing business models). The notably interdisciplinary character provides scholars and policy professionals working in specific (legal, political, engineering) disciplines a unique outlook on how policy making, implementation, and pilots are related in multi-level and cross-border governance. The book presents the results of the EU-funded ""Mobile Cross-Border Government Services for Europe"" (mGov4EU) project in which various pilots implemented and validated enhanced infrastructure services for electronic voting, smart mobility, and mobile signing. Together, the single pilots demonstrated how enhanced electronic identities and trust services (eIDAS) and Single Digital Gateway Regulation (SDGR) layers can accommodate once-only, digital-by-default and mobile-first principles. By taking advantage of security features of modern smartphones like hardware-backed secure elements together with integrated convenience elements like biometric sensors, this research showed how both the security needs and data-protection expectations one has into public services and the usability challenges that arise when accessing complex services using constrained mobile devices meet. This book is the first one in his kind to address this gap in the academic knowledge, as well as this gap in available compendiums for policy professionals at European levels of decision-making, as well as for policymakers and experts working on electronic identification, cross-border and cross-sector information exchange in the various member states of the European Union. This way, it serves various audiences: first, researchers in informatics-related areas like information systems, electronic government, and mobile applications, as it describes empirical examples of secure, easy-to-use and cross-border electronic services that have been developed and successfully tested in practice. Second, it also caters to researchers in international relations or political science as well as policymakers and politicians, both at national or European levels, who are involved in drafting policies and implementing European initiatives in relation to the building blocks of next-generation e-government services.";"Cham : Springer, 2024.

The interest in this phenomenon dates back to at least the 18th century when Adam Smith (1759) argued that imitation can be seen as a primitive form of sympathy. Despite the longstanding interest, it was not until the 20th century that different research fields within psychology and neuroscience started empirically investigating this social phenomenon.

It is based on the CLEOPATRA International Training Network, which explored how we analyze and understand the major events that influence and shape our lives and societies, and how they unfold online. This analysis was achieved through various case studies, the development of novel methodologies in fields such as data mining and natural language processing, and the creation of new event-centric datasets aggregated in the Open Event Knowledge Graph (OEKG), a multilingual event-centric knowledge graph that contains more than 1 million events in 15 languages.The book is divided into three parts, focusing on different aspects of event analytics across languages and communities: Part I Event-centric Multilingual and Multimodal NLP Technologies presents five chapters reporting on recent developments in NLP technologies required to process multilingual information. Next, the four chapters of Part II: Event-centric Multilingual Knowledge Technologies discuss technologies integrating multilingual event-centric information in knowledge graphs and providing user access to such information. Finally, Part III: Event Analytics covers three selected aspects of multilingual event analytics, namely an analysis of event-centric news spreading barriers, claim detection in social media, and the narrativization of events as a means of presenting event data.This book is mainly written for researchers in academia and industry, who work on topics like natural language processing, large language models, multilingual information retrieval or event analytics.";"Cham : Springer, 2024.

288699;"Nondestructive Assay of Nuclear Materials for Safeguards and Security : Ensuring Safe Practices /";"Geist, William H.";"This open access book describes the nondestructive assay techniques that are used for the measurement of nuclear material (primarily uranium and plutonium) for nuclear material accountancy purposes. It is a substantial revision to the so-called PANDA manual that has been a standard reference since its publication in 1991. The book covers the origin and interactions of gamma rays and neutrons as they affect nuclear measurements and also describes the theory and practice of calorimetry. The book gives a description of many instruments based on these techniques that are applied in the field.Although the basic physics has not changed since PANDA was first published, the last thirty years have seen many advances in analysis methods, instrumentation, and applications. The basic descriptions of the origin and interactions of radiation have been updated and include newer references. There have been extensive revisions of the description of gamma detection methods, attenuation correction procedures, and analysis methods, including for the measurement of uranium enrichment and the determination of plutonium isotopic composition. Extensive revisions and additions have also been made to the description of neutron detectors and to the explanation of neutron coincidence techniques. The chapter on neutron multiplicity techniques is a new addition to this edition. The applications of gamma and neutron techniques have been completely overhauled to remove obsolete systems and to include many current applications. The values of, and references to, nuclear data have been updated. This updated edition is an essential reference for academic researchers and practitioners in the field.

288703;"EU Foreign Policy in a Fragmenting International Order : Challenges and Strategies /";"Costa, Oriol.";"This open access book delves into the responses of EU actors, such as member states, institutions, and political groups in the European Parliament, to the fragmentation of the liberal international order (LIO). The analytical framework adopted in this volume explores the diverse interpretations of this phenomenon and the various political initiatives associated with them. Among these interpretations is the concept of strategic autonomy, which has emerged as a key feature of debates surrounding the EU's adaptation to a fragmented LIO. The contributors examine these dynamics across different issue areas and dimensions of EU foreign policy, encompassing the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), external relations, and the externalization of internal policies. They use the term fragmentation to refer to a bundle of processes affecting the LIO that range from challenges to the universality of human rights to the crisis of global governance instruments, from the bifurcation of tech to protectionist tendencies in trade policies.";"Cham : Palgrave Macmillan, 2024.

SSES is the largest international effort to collect data on these skills among 10- and 15-year-old students.The report explores how the following skills differ by socio-demographic groups and how they relate to key life outcomes: task performance skills (persistence, responsibility, self-control and achievement motivation); emotional regulation skills (stress-resistance, emotional control and optimism); engaging with others skills (assertiveness, sociability and energy); open-mindedness skills (curiosity, creativity and tolerance); and collaboration skills (empathy and trust).The results show that students' social and emotional skills - or 21st century skills - are linked to better life outcomes, including academic success, greater life satisfaction, healthier behaviours, less test and class anxiety, and more ambitious career plans. The Survey also finds that these skills are inequitably distributed among students by age, gender, and socio-economic background.SSES 2023 was conducted in Bulgaria, Chile, Peru, Spain, Mexico, Ukraine, Bogotá (Colombia), Delhi (India), Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Emilia-Romagna (Italy), Gunma (Japan), Helsinki (Finland), Jinan (China), Kudus (Indonesia), Sobral (Brazil) and Turin (Italy).

288707;"Infections in Surgery : Prevention and Management /";"Bartoli, Stefano.";"Infections in surgery, commonly known as surgical site infections (SSIs), are complications that may occur after a surgical procedure. SSIs represent a serious problem leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs, highlighting the need for continued efforts to improve surgical practices and reduce their incidence.Several factors can contribute to the development of SSIs: patient-related factors (such as obesity, advanced age, diabetes, immunosuppression, pre-existing infections etc.); preoperative preparation-related factors (such as incomplete skin antisepsis or failure to administer appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis); microbial contamination (despite sterile techniques, microorganisms can infect the surgical site); surgical procedure-related factors (duration and complexity of the surgeries); postoperative care-related factors (such as inadequate wound care or infection control measures).To prevent SSIs, healthcare facilities implement various strategies, including: optimization of patients' conditions before surgery; preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis; strict sterile technique; postoperative wound care; surveillance and monitoring to identify and address SSIs early, preventing their spread and complications.Despite the evidence supporting the effectiveness of best practices, many clinicians fail to implement them, and evidence-based practices that optimize both the prevention and treatment of SSIs tend to be underused, highlighting the importance of ongoing research and improvement in surgical techniques and infection control practices.This open access book provides a practical toolkit for surgeons and intensivists to improve their daily clinical practices in order to reduce the risk of SSIs.";"Cham : Springer, 2024.

288708;"The Middle East and North Africa : Historical, Social, and Political Perspectives /";"Zemmin, Florian.";"This volume collects reflections on secularity from the Middle East and North Africa. To highlight proximate connections as well as resonances with debates elsewhere, it includes premodern contributions from the region as well as Jewish thought from Europe that have provided significant references for modern appropriations of secularity.The texts, for the most part previously untranslated, reflect commonalities within the region as well as its great diversity. Thus, while Islam is a common reference for most of our authors, the selections point to its varied invocations in the interest of differing political ends. Others write from a Christian or Jewish perspective, or subscribe to non-religious intellectual traditions. They range from premodern Muslim jurisprudents and philosophers to Ottoman statesmen, Arab socialist and nationalist intellectuals of the interwar period, Iranian revolutionaries, Israeli novelists, and finally, post-secular intellectuals, lay and religious, predominantly from the former Islamic heartland: modern Arab states and Iran. Several introductions weave together the swathe of topics raised in the discussions, beginning with a schematic presentation of the concerns that undergird the volume's organization.";"Berlin/Boston : Walter de Gruyter GmbH, 2024.

288709;"Influencer Politics : At the Intersection of Personal, Political, and Promotional /";"Arnesson, Johanna.";"Influencer Politics focuses on current discussions about the role and impact of social media influencers in the political sphere, and how the personal, political and promotional often converges in digital media. A key question is how core ideas of influencer culture - authenticity, intimacy, commercialism, and self-branding - shape the ways in which politics are expressed and understood in this context, as well as opens up space for new ways of connecting and interacting with the public. It also highlights the way that influencer culture itself is infused with politics, where issues of, for example, empowerment and exploitation are articulated and discussed in different ways. The book is the result of a common interest among researchers engaged in work on political aspects of influencer marketing and influencer culture from critical, cultural, and strategic perspectives, and offers a range of case studies devoted to both the promises and limitations of influencer politics.";"Berlin/Boston : Walter de Gruyter GmbH, 2024.

288710;"Turbulence Across the Sea : Transatlantic Relations and Strategic Competition /";"Baranets, Elie.";"Great Power competition is back. On the two sides of the Atlantic, however, this concept often means different things. While the United States is focused on China, Europe is preoccupied with Russia. Yet shifting American priorities toward Asia requires reconceptualizing the future role of NATO. In Europe, this shift has led to serious thought about how to achieve strategic autonomy that will allow Europe to guarantee its own security regardless of strategic choices made in Washington. As Chinese strategy focuses on dividing European actors and making them more economically dependent on Beijing, these developments may undermine Washington's influence in Europe while limiting potential European action against Chinese interests. With a mix of research methodologies applied by scholars from both sides of the Atlantic, Turbulence Across the Sea offers a comprehensive analysis of relations among European and North American actors in the context of strategic competition among the United States, Europe, Russia, and China. In doing so, it demonstrates that a reaffirmation of transatlantic cooperation is necessary to maintain security in the face of aggressive moves by both Russia and China. By analyzing attitudes from the perspective of both the various actors (Britain, France, Germany, and the European Union) and various sectors (intelligence cooperation, foreign direct investments, technology, and the defense industry), this book provides readers with a comprehensive perspective on the challenges and opportunities in the shifting landscape of security in the twenty-first century.";"Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2024.

Disaster risk mitigation, climate change, global food security, resource management, and environmental challenges all are interlinked through earth systems and processes that are independent of human constructs. Therefore, these case studies highlight methods and practices of spatial information mining and integrated SDG evaluation, which include evaluating the synergy and trade-off relationships among the SDGs in the context of their correlations; simulating multiple indicators' interactions in future environmental, economic and social scenarios in the context of their temporal variations; designing integrated evaluations of regional SDGs in the context of experience with the study of multiple indicators.

288714;"Post-Truth Populism : A New Political Paradigm /";"Newman, Saul.";"This open access book analyses the convergence between 'post-truth' political culture and the politics of populism. The premise is that there is an intrinsic link between post-truth discourse (referring to mis/disinformation, 'alternative facts', 'fake news', conspiracy theories and the general distrust of expert knowledge and official sources of information) and the central narrative of populism, which opposes the 'common sense' wisdom of ordinary honest people to the 'expert knowledge' of duplicitous technocratic elites. The book investigates the current post-truth phenomenon as a distinct feature of contemporary political life, and the specific ways in which it intersects with the resurgence of populism. While there has been a considerable literature on both post-truth and populism, they are largely treated as separate phenomena, and very little research has been conducted on their actual connection. The original contribution of this book to an emerging field of study is to develop a strong, coherent and empirically informed theoretical framework for understanding the specific paradigm of post-truth populism. The authors propose this paradigm as a way of interpreting different contemporary political phenomena, such as conspiracy theories, political destabilisation, and debates around immigration, the role of journalists and the media, climate change, gender and sexuality, Islam, and minority rights, as well as a way of understanding the threats and challenges this poses to the liberal democratic model and way of life.";"Cham : Palgrave Macmillan, 2024.

288716;"Pushing the Paradigm of Global Water Security : Transnational Perspectives for the Next Generations /";"Anker, Victoria.";"This book brings together early career researchers, non-governmental organisations and industry practitioners, indigenous and local communities, and government agency workers to interrogate the concept of water security. By collating their multicultural perspectives, diverse contributions, and illustrative media, we challenge the current anthropocentric, technocratic narrative of water security, according to which: water security is solely for humans; development initiatives and interventions are driven by neocolonial and neoliberal ideologies; the socio-cultural approach to water security is secondary to a technical, engineering-based approach; and interdisciplinarity is not practical in its application. Presented here is an amalgamation of our personal and professional efforts to address these challenges. The nuance of this book is in our methodology: transnational cooperation, collaboration across disciplines, and diagnostic problem-solving. While we do not promise a single solution (there is no such thing as 'one size fits all'), we believe this timely contribution broadens the discussion around water security through its firm rejection of reductionist approaches to this most complex of 'wicked problems'. Most notably, we push for the radical acceptance of the indivisibility of environmental conservation, social stability, and economic vitality. We resist the temptation of 'green growth', recognising it as little more than neoliberalism in disguise. The brilliance, innovation, and recall to tradition that emerge through this book demonstrate the importance of solutions that are informed by a plurality of knowledge types (from scientific and technical to indigenous and local) and generated through collaboration and partnerships to support the attainment of socio-ecological justice. Essential reading for water practitioners, policy makers, and multilateral organisations in the development sector, it is also a must-read for doctoral and master's students working at intersections of water, and undergraduates who want to challenge their subject-specific perspectives on water and push disciplinary boundaries.";"London : IWA Publishing, 2024.

As they hunt for profit margins, rent, and dividends, they simultaneously critique capitalism and posit their pursuit of assets as a form of resistance. Bohyeong Kim theorizes this new spirit of capitalism in South Korea as ""critical capitalism,"" arguing that it reflects the popular discontent with both national development and financial neoliberalism. As a paradoxical critique and legitimation, Bohyeong Kim argues that critical capitalism valorizes the capitalist economy not through a triumphant narrative, but by highlighting the emotional wounds, destroyed communities, and oppressive tactics of modern capitalism. Drawing on multi-sited ethnography and in-depth interviews with a broad community of aspiring millionaires, Critically Capitalist illuminates how contemporary capitalism thrives by channeling discontent into financial and real estate markets, which in turn, has cemented critical capitalism as the cultural and affective backbone of South Korea's economy.";"Ann Arbor [Michigan] : University of Michigan Press, 2025.

288846;"Community Energy and Sustainable Energy Transitions : Experiences from Ethiopia, Malawi and Mozambique /";;"This open access book engages with the difficulties of delivering community energy in practice, building on practical experiences in Ethiopia, Malawi, and Mozambique. In these countries, where many people face a substantial gap in access rates to electricity, community energy is an alternative to advance universal energy access. This book argues that, besides providing access, community energy is essential for achieving justice and resilience in the transition to sustainable energy. Community energy plays a fundamental role in sustainable energy transitions. Community energy combines off-grid infrastructures with innovative forms of governance to incorporate the perspectives of beneficiaries in the generation and distribution of electricity. Community energy systems have multiple benefits for communities, such as facilitating the adoption of renewable technologies, providing energy access where it is lacking, and building resilience. They also offer societal benefits beyond beneficiary communities, such as providing additional capacity to existing grids, delivering off-grid services where the grid is absent, and bridging on-grid and off-grid systems. Despite its promises, however, the adoption of community energy has been slow. This book presents a feminist-informed perspective on community energy to advance energy justice that puts disadvantaged communities at the centre of the transition. It also explores the room for manoeuvre within existing regulatory systems, supply chains, and delivery systems to facilitate its development. By engaging with existing experiences in community energy, the book demonstrates the potential of communities to gain control over their energy needs and resources and argues for the need to develop a wide range of transdisciplinary skills among policymakers, technicians and communities to deliver a just energy transition. Vanesa Castán Broto is Professor of Climate Urbanism at the University of Sheffield. She is Principal Investigator of the project Community Energy And Sustainable Energy Transitions In Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique (CESET), funded by the UK Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF). The project has built a collaborative, multi-institutional partnership bringing together a network of researchers across Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, and the UK to discuss social-oriented alternatives to deliver sustainable energy futures.";"Cham : Palgrave Macmillan, 2024.

Now, these forms of life solidify automatically by transforming into data.

In 21st-century welfare, consumption and production will be considered as the two faces of the same reality. The possibility to create new value is precisely what sets Webfare apart from traditional welfare: it recognizes the new value created by the Web, and aims to use it for everyone's well-being.";"Bielefeld : transcript Verlag, 2024.

288840;"Globalization in State Socialist East Central Europe : Looking Beyond Dominant Narratives /";"Tomka, Béla,";"This open access Palgrave Pivot explores four major aspects of globalization: foreign trade, capital and information flows, and the movement of people. The book examines how the state socialist countries of East Central Europe fit into the general trend of globalization after WWII. It focuses on three specific countries in the region: Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. The study also considers conceptual problems: whether recently introduced terms such as 'alternative globalization' and 'socialist proto-globalization' are plausible for interpreting state socialist globalization. Special attention is paid to the study of continuities and discontinuities in the process of globalization in East Central Europe, which is a key issue in current debates. This requires a long-term perspective, so the study covers not only the decades before 1989 but also subsequent developments. In doing so, the book attempts to find a balance between old and new mainstream interpretations: it recognises that East Central European societies experienced considerable globalization during the state socialist era; however, based on empirical findings, instead of 'alternative' or 'proto-' globalization, the book suggests other notions to conceptualize this process, including fragmentation, selectivity, and unevenness. Thus, the proposed understanding could also contribute to discussions on globalization beyond East Central Europe. Béla Tomka is a professor of Contemporary Social and Economic History at the University of Szeged, Hungary. He is the author of 16 books including Welfare in East and West (2004), A Social History of Twentieth-Century Europe (2013, winner of 'Outstanding Academic Title 2013 Award' by Choice, American Library Association), Austerities and Aspirations: A Comparative History of Growth, Consumption and Quality of Life in East Central Europe since 1945 (2020), and the editor of several other volumes.

Whether you're new to the subject or not, a decision-maker, a practitioner or simply a AI user, this book will help you gain a better understanding of HCAI's impact on our societies. |  ""Artificial intelligence (AI) permeates our lives in a growing number of ways. Relying solely on traditional, technology-driven approaches won't suffice to develop and deploy that technology in a way that truly enhances human experience. A new concept is desperately needed to reach that goal. That concept is Human-Centered AI (HCAI). With 23 captivating chapters, this book delves deep into the realm of HCAI. In Section 1, it demystifies HCAI, exploring cutting-edge trends and approaches in its study, including the moral landscape of Large Language Models. Section 2 looks at how HCAI is viewed in different institutions-like the justice system, health system, and higher education-and how it could affect them. It examines how crafting HCAI could lead to better work. Section 3 offers practical insights and successful strategies to transform HCAI from theory to reality, for example, studying how using regulatory sandboxes could ensure the development of age-appropriate AI for kids. Finally, decision-makers and practitioners provide invaluable perspectives throughout the book, showcasing the real-world significance of its articles beyond academia.

289103;"Racism in America : A Reader /";;"Racism in America has been the subject of serious scholarship for decades. At Harvard University Press, we've had the honor of publishing some of the most influential books on the subject. The excerpts in this volume-culled from works of history, law, sociology, medicine, economics, critical theory, philosophy, art, and literature-are an invitation to understand anti-Black racism through the eyes of our most incisive commentators. Readers will find such classic selections as Toni Morrison's description of the Africanist presence in the White American literary imagination, Walter Johnson's depiction of the nation's largest slave market, and Stuart Hall's theorization of the relationship between race and nationhood. More recent voices include Khalil Gibran Muhammad on the pernicious myth of Black criminality, Elizabeth Hinton on the link between mass incarceration and 1960s social welfare programs, Anthony Abraham Jack on how elite institutions continue to fail first-generation college students, Mehrsa Baradaran on the racial wealth gap, Nicole Fleetwood on carceral art, and Joshua Bennett on the anti-Black bias implicit in how we talk about animals and the environment. Because the experiences of non-White people are integral to the history of racism and often bound up in the story of Black Americans, we have included writers who focus on the struggles of Native Americans, Latinos, and Asians as well. Racism in America is for all curious readers, teachers, and students who wish to discover for themselves the complex and rewarding intellectual work that has sustained our national conversation on race and will continue to guide us in future years.";"Cambridge, MA :  Harvard University Press,  [2021] ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289103

This book takes up traditional approaches to political science. It aims to offer a mixture of conventional and specific analyses and insights for different groups of readers. In view of the European Union's multi-level and multi-actor polity, the book highlights the complex procedural and institutional set-up of nation states preparing and implementing decisions made by the institutions of the European Community (EC). In looking at the emerging and evolving realities of the European polity, it shows how European institutions and Member States (re-)act and interact in a new institutional and procedural set-up. It explores how governmental and non-governmental actors in different national settings adapt to common challenges, constraints and opportunities for which they are mainly themselves responsible. The book discusses the Belgian policy toward European integration as a significant demonstration of its commitment to multilateralism and international co-operation in security and economic affairs. Attitudes to European integration in Denmark, Germany, Finland, Greece, and Spain are discussed. Tendencies towards 'Europeanisation' and 'sectoralisation' of the ministerial administration during the process of European integration and the typical administrative pluralism of the Italian political system seem to have mutually reinforced each other. Strong multi-level players are able to increase their access and influence at both levels and to use their position on one level for strengthening their say on the other. German and Belgian regions might develop into these kinds of actors. A persistent trend during the 1990s is traced towards stronger national performers, particularly in terms of adaptations and reactions to Maastricht Treaty.";"Manchester :  Manchester University Press,  [2018] ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289109

How well did civilian morale stand up to the pressures of total war and what factors were important to it? This book rejects contentions that civilian morale fell a long way short of the favourable picture presented at the time and in hundreds of books and films ever since. While acknowledging that some negative attitudes and behaviour existed-panic and defeatism, ration-cheating and black-marketeering-it argues that these involved a very small minority of the population. In fact, most people behaved well, and this should be the real measure of civilian morale, rather than the failing of the few who behaved badly. The book shows that although before the war, the official prognosis was pessimistic, measures to bolster morale were taken nevertheless, in particular with regard to protection against air raids. An examination of indicative factors concludes that moral fluctuated but was in the main good, right to the end of the war. In examining this phenomenon, due credit is accorded to government policies for the maintenance of morale, but special emphasis is given to the 'invisible chain' of patriotic feeling that held the nation together during its time of trial.";"Manchester :  Manchester University Press,  [2018] ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289111

289121;"The politics of maps : cartographic constructions of Israel/Palestine /";"Leuenberger, Christine,";"""This book traces how the geographical sciences have become entwined with politics, territorial claim making, and nation-building in Israel/Palestine. In particular, the focus is on the history of geographical sciences before and after the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, and how surveying, mapping, and naming the new territory become a crucial part of its making. With the 1993 Oslo Interim Agreement, Palestinians also surveyed and mapped the territory allocated to a future State of Palestine, with the expectation that they will, within five years, gain full sovereignty. In both cases, maps served to evoke a sense of national identity, facilitated a state's ability to govern, and helped delineate territory. Besides maps geopolitical functions for nation-state building, they also become weapons in map wars. Before and after the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, maps of the region became one of the many battlefields in which political conflicts over land claims and the ethno-national identity of this contested land were being waged. Aided by an increasingly user-defined mapping environment, Israeli and Palestinian governmental and non-governmental organizations increasingly relied on the rhetoric of maps in order to put forth their geopolitical visions. Such struggles over land and its rightful owners in Israel/Palestine exemplify processes underway in other states across the globe, whether in South Africa or Ukraine, which are engaged in disputes over territorial boundaries, national identities, and the territorial integrity of nation-states. Maps, no less, have become crucial tools in these struggles""--";"New York, NY : Oxford University Press, 2020 ";"1. Why Maps Matter .-- 2.

In the case of Israel and its indispensable ally, the United States, the central mythology is ""the Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity,"" as the Israeli diplomat Abba Eban famously said in a 1973 statement that has been widely quoted ever since. However, the historical truth is very nearly the converse: it is Israel and the U.S. that have repeatedly lost or deliberately dismissed many opportunities to reach fair compromise settlements of the Arab-Israeli and Israeli-Palestinian conflicts. The book reexamines the entire history of the conflict from its onset at the end of WWI through today. Part I begins with a reconsideration of Zionism and then examines the origins and early years of the Arab-Israeli state conflict. One chapter is devoted to the question of what accounts for the nearly unconditional U.S. support of Israel throughout the entire conflict. Part II focuses on war and peace in the Arab-Israeli state conflict from 1948 through today, arguing that all the major wars-in 1948, 1956, 1967, 1973--could and should have been avoided.

Political violence rips apart several towns in southwest Texas. A far-right militia plots to kidnap the governor of Michigan and try her for treason. An armed mob of Trump supporters and conspiracy theorists storms the U.S. Capitol. Are these isolated incidents? Or is this the start of something bigger? Barbara F. Walter has spent her career studying civil conflict in places like Iraq and Sri Lanka, but now she has become increasingly worried about her own country. Perhaps surprisingly, both autocracies and healthy democracies are largely immune from civil war; it's the countries in the middle ground that are most vulnerable. And this is where more and more countries, including the United States, are finding themselves today. Over the last two decades, the number of active civil wars around the world has almost doubled. Walter reveals the warning signs-where wars tend to start, who initiates them, what triggers them-and why some countries tip over into conflict while others remain stable. Drawing on the latest international research and lessons from over twenty countries, Walter identifies the crucial risk factors, from democratic backsliding to factionalization and the politics of resentment. A civil war today won't look like America in the 1860s, Russia in the 1920s, or Spain in the 1930s. It will begin with sporadic acts of violence and terror, accelerated by social media. It will sneak up on us and leave us wondering how we could have been so blind.

'A compelling history of the dark arts of statecraft... Fascinating' Jonathan Rugman 'Rich in anecdote and detail.' The Times Today's world is in flux. Competition between the great powers is back on the agenda and governments around the world are turning to secret statecraft and the hidden hand to navigate these uncertain waters. From poisonings to electoral interference, subversion to cyber sabotage, states increasingly operate in the shadows, while social media has created new avenues for disinformation on a mass scale. This is covert action: perhaps the most sensitive - and controversial - of all state activity. However, for all its supposed secrecy, it has become surprisingly prominent - and it is something that has the power to affect all of us. In an enthralling and urgent narrative packed with real-world examples, Rory Cormac reveals how such activity is shaping the world and argues that understanding why and how states wield these dark arts has never been more important.";"London : Atlantic Books, 2022.

289126;"The politics of cybersecurity in the Middle East / ";"Shires, James,";"Cybersecurity is a complex and contested issue in international politics. By focusing on the 'great powers'--the US, the EU, Russia and China--studies in the field often fail to capture the specific politics of cybersecurity in the Middle East, especially in Egypt and the GCC states. For these countries, cybersecurity policies and practices are entangled with those of long-standing allies in the US and Europe, and are built on reciprocal flows of data, capital, technology and expertise. At the same time, these states have authoritarian systems of governance more reminiscent of Russia or China, including approaches to digital technologies centred on sovereignty and surveillance.

This book is a pioneering examination of the politics of cybersecurity in the Middle East. Drawing on new interviews and original fieldwork, James Shires shows how the label of cybersecurity is repurposed by states, companies and other organisations to encompass a variety of concepts, including state conflict, targeted spyware, domestic information controls, and foreign interference through leaks and disinformation. These shifting meanings shape key technological systems as well as the social relations underpinning digital development. But however the term is interpreted, it is clear that cybersecurity is an integral aspect of the region's contemporary politics.";"London: C.

Richard Kerbaj, an award-winning investigative journalist and filmmaker, bypasses the usual censorship channels to tell the definitive account of authoritative but unauthorised stories of the Western world's most powerful but least known intelligence alliance made up of the US, Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. As Kerbaj shows, spy stories are never better than when they are true - and these span from 1930s Nazi spy rings to the most recent developments in Ukraine and China. Through personal interviews with world leaders - including British Prime Ministers Theresa May and David Cameron - and more than 100 intelligence officials, this book explores the complex personalities who helped shape the Five Eyes. They include a Scotland Yard detective who became a spymaster and inspired the first exchanges between MI5 and the FBI. An American home economics teacher who helped create one of the most effective programmes to counter Soviet espionage. The CIA's lone officer in Budapest during the Hungarian Revolution. GCHQ's chief during the Edward Snowden intelligence leak. And the Australian politician turned diplomat whose tip-off to the FBI instigated the inquiry into Russia's meddling in the US presidential contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Richard Kerbaj is able to draw from deep inside the secret corridors of power and his unparalleled access spans all 5 countries. Some of the people he has interviewed include former GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban, CIA director General David Petraeus, MI5 director-general Eliza Manningham-Buller, NSA director Admiral Mike Rogers, British National Security Advisor Kim Darroch, ASIO chief Mike Burgess, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service's chief Richard Fadden, and Ciaran Martin, the official who oversaw Britain's assessments on whether the Chinese telecoms firm, Huawei, should have had a role in the creation of the UK's 5G network""--Publisher's description.";"London, England : Blink, 2022.

289129;"Hidden geopolitics : governance in a globalized world /";"Agnew, John A.,";"Geopolitics is not dead, but nor does it involve the same old logic of a world determined by physical geography in a competition between Great Powers. Hidden Geopolitics recaptures the term to explore how the geography of power works both globally and nationally to structure and govern the workings of the global political economy. Globalization, far from its antithesis, is tightly wound up in the assumptions and practices of geopolitics, relating to the scope of regulatory authority, state sponsorship, and the political power of businesses to operate worldwide. Agnew shows how this ""hidden"" geopolitics and globalization have been vitally connected. He focuses on three moments: the origins of contemporary globalization in the policies pursued by successive US governments and allies after 1945 and its continued relevance even as the US role in the world changes; the close connection between geopolitical history and status of different countries and their relative capacities to exploit the possibilities and limit the costs of globalization; and new regulatory and standard-setting agencies which emerged under the sponsorship of major geopolitical powers but have grown in power and authority as the dominant states have become limited in their ability to manage the explosion of transnational transactions on their own. Agnew argues that it is time to move on from the narrow inter-imperial cast of geopolitics and the foolish policy advice it produces. The old perspective on geopolitics has taken on new life with the rise of national-populist movements in Europe and the United States and the reinvigoration of territorial-authoritarian regimes in Russia and China. Notwithstanding this trend, we must see the contemporary world through the lens of these complex, ""hidden"" geopolitical underpinnings that Agnew seeks to expose.";"Lanham : Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2022 ";"Geopolitics in a globalized world -- Beyond territorial geopolitics -- Making the strange familiar -- The asymmetric border : the US place in the world and the refugee panic of 2018 -- Putting China in the world -- Territorial politics after the financial crisis -- Anti-federalist federalism -- Global regulation -- Managing the Eurozone crisis.

U.S. Naval Power in the 21st Century provides such a framework for the changed world we live in, offering a detailed roadmap that shows how the United States can field a war-winning fleet that can also compete aggressively in peacetime against dangerous competitors unlike any the nation has faced before. Brent Sadler presents a compelling new strategy and organizing approach that he calls naval statecraft, which acknowledges the centrality and importance of the maritime domain. While similar in scale and scope to Cold War containment strategies against the Soviets, naval statecraft is much more. It must be to challenge China's involvement in global supply chains, which gives that country significant financial heft and influence around the world. Unlike what existed during of the Cold War, however, Sadler provides a unique vision for competing with China and Russia. Rather than simply calling for better coordinated U.S. diplomacy, military operations, and economic statecraft, Sadler argues for integrating the levers of national power coherently and in a sustainable way. This is no small feat, and his approach is informed by a long career rich in working with various agencies of government, foreign militaries (including hostile ones), and our allies. It is an approach imminently appropriate to our times but comes with a realization that the nation is not ready for the competition it faces from China and Russia.

As a four-star officer, I commanded United States Central Command during the most significant three years in the history of the modern Middle East""-- | ""As the Commander of U.S. Central Command, General Frank McKenzie oversaw some of the most important - and controversial operations in modern U.S. military history. He had direct operational responsibility for the strikes on Qassem Soleimani and two successive leaders of ISIS, the many months of deterrence operations against Iran and its proxies, and the methodical drawdown in Iraq. He directed the noncombatant evacuation operation in Afghanistan, and our final withdrawal from that tortured country. The Melting Point has three themes. The first one is the importance of the primacy of civilian control of the military. It has become a widely perceived truth that this control has been eroded over the past few years. General McKenzie doesn't believe that to be the case, and he speaks with some authority on the matter arguing that the civ-mil relationship isn't perfect or frictionless, but it doesn't have to be, and probably shouldn't be. It is, however, more durable than many believe, and is supported and embraced by the military to a degree that some critics do not choose to recognize. The second theme is the uniqueness of being a combatant commander. Combatant commanders participate in the development of policy, although as junior partners. They are also responsible for the execution of policy once civilian leaders have formulated their decision, a unique position, and very different than the role of a service chief, or even the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. None of these officers are in the chain of command, and they have no ultimate, mortal responsibility or authority for execution. Only the combatant commander stands astride the boundary of decision-making and execution. Finally, the third theme that McKenzie argues is that leaders matter, and the decisions they make have a profound effect on what happens on the battlefield. McKenzie provides an honest assessment of his time in command-describing decisions that were sound, as well as some outcomes he wishes were different. He offers a vivid portrait of leadership in action in one of the most volatile regions of the world""--";"Annapolis, Maryland : Naval Institute Press, 2024 ";"How it all began : alarums and excursions -- Central command -- Confronting Iran -- Finishing Baghdadi -- Soleimani -- Aftermath -- The summer of our discontent -- Drawing down the long war in Afghanistan -- Long December -- Cleansing the temple : the new team -- The noose tightens in Afghanistan -- An inconvenient truth : reality intrudes in Afghanistan -- No safety or surprise : the end in Afghanistan -- Accountability -- Iran, Iraq, and Syria -- Considering Phlebas.

289140;"Why war? / ";"Overy, R. J.,";"""An Economist Best Book of 2024 Why has war been such a consistent presence throughout the human past? A leading historian explains, drawing on rich examples and keen insight.

Richard Overy is not the first scholar to take up the title question. In 1931, at the request of the League of Nations, Albert Einstein asked Sigmund Freud to collaborate on a short work examining whether there was ""a way of delivering mankind from the menace of war."" Published the next year as a pamphlet entitled Why War?, it conveyed Freud's conclusion that the ""death drive"" made any deliverance impossible--the psychological impulse to destruction was universal in the animal kingdom. The global wars of the later 1930s and 1940s seemed ample evidence of the dismal conclusion.

A preeminent historian of those wars, Overy brings vast knowledge to the title question and years of experience unraveling the knotted motivations of war. His approach is to separate the major drivers and motivations, and consider the ways each has contributed to organized conflict. They range from the impulses embedded in human biology and psychology, to the incentives to conflict developed through cultural evolution, to competition for resources--conflicts stirred by the passions of belief, the effects of ecological stresses, the drive for power in leaders and nations, and the search for security. The discussions show remarkable range, delving deep into the Neolithic past, through the twentieth-century world wars, and up to the current conflict in Ukraine. The examples are absorbing, from the Roman Empire's voracious appetite for resources to the impulse to power evident in Alexander the Great, Napoleon, and Hitler. The conclusion is not hopeful, but Overy's book is a gift to readers: a compact, judicious, engrossing examination of a fundamental question.";"New York, NY : W. W.

289138;"A world of insecurity : democratic disenchantment in rich and poor countries /";"Bardhan, Pranab K.,";"An ambitious account of the corrosion of liberal democracy in rich and poor countries alike, arguing that antidemocratic sentiment reflects fear of material and cultural loss, not a critique of liberalism's failure to deliver equality, and suggesting possible ways out. The retreat of liberal democracy in the twenty-first century has been impossible to ignore. From Wisconsin to Warsaw, Budapest to Bangalore, the public is turning against pluralism and liberal institutions and instead professing unapologetic nationalism and majoritarianism. Critics of inequality argue that this is a predictable response to failures of capitalism and liberalism, but Pranab Bardhan, a development economist, sees things differently. The problem is not inequality but insecurity--financial and cultural. Bardhan notes that antidemocratic movements have taken root globally in a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic groups. In the United States, older, less-educated, rural populations have withdrawn from democracy. But in India, the prevailing Hindu Nationalists enjoy the support of educated, aspirational urban youth. And in Europe, antidemocratic populists firmly back the welfare state (but for nonimmigrants). What is consistent among antidemocrats is fear of losing what they have. That could be money but is most often national pride and culture and the comfort of tradition. A World of Insecurity argues for context-sensitive responses. Some, like universal basic income schemes, are better suited to poor countries. Others, like worker empowerment and international coordination, have broader appeal. But improving material security won't be enough to sustain democracy. Nor, Bardhan writes, should we be tempted by the ultimately hollow lure of China's authoritarian model. He urges liberals to adopt at least a grudging respect for fellow citizens' local attachments. By affirming civic forms of community pride, we might hope to temper cultural anxieties before they become pathological.";"Cambridge, Massachusetts : Harvard University Press, 2022 ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289138

As AI's power grows, so does the need to figure out what-and who-this technology is really for. AI Needs You argues that it is critical for society to take the lead in answering this urgent question and ensuring that AI fulfills its promise.Verity Harding draws inspiring lessons from the histories of three twentieth-century tech revolutions-the space race, in vitro fertilization, and the internet-to empower each of us to join the conversation about AI and its possible futures. Sharing her perspective as a leading insider in technology and politics, she rejects the dominant narrative, which often likens AI's advent to that of the atomic bomb. History points the way to an achievable future in which democratically determined values guide AI to be peaceful in its intent; to embrace limitations; serve purpose, not profit; and to be firmly rooted in societal trust. AI Needs You gives us hope that we, the people, can imbue AI with a deep intentionality that reflects our best values, ideals, and interests, and that serves the public good. AI will permeate our lives in unforeseeable ways, but it is clear that the shape of AI's future-and of our own-cannot be left only to those building it. It is up to us to guide this technology away from our worst fears toward a future that we can trust and believe in""-- | ""This brief and accessible book draws lessons from the history and governance of three recent transformative technologies - the space race, in-vitro fertilization (IVF), and the internet - to argue that society can and should take an active role in shaping the future of artificial intelligence (AI). It is a manifesto aimed at empowering the reader to participate in the conversations and political and democratic processes that will determine the intentions of AI, what values and regulations should guide its development, and its future. Artificial intelligence affects most of us every day, from determining what news we read and music we listen to, to influencing credit scores and legal decisions. As computers become smarter, and the amount of data available to train sophisticated algorithms grows, these unprecedented abilities are coming to play an ever more central role in how our society functions. Yet, as important as this new technology is and will be, it is little understood outside of an unaccountable, insular, and hard-to-scrutinize tech community. Creators of AI-driven systems often operate quickly, at large scale, and without any clear sense of societal purpose or understanding of the diversity and complexity of the human condition. As these systems become increasingly powerful, figuring out what, and who, this technology is for is critical, if we want to ensure that advances in AI will advance us as a species, inspire us as a people, and support the delicate fabric of society. What values framework permeates this new technology, which will permeate our lives? What values are needed - to guide us into a future of which we can all be proud? By looking back, Harding shows that science and technology are clearly not neutral, but inherently political, dictated by the human values and preferences of their time. Recognizing this gives us cause for hope; democratic and political judgement can and must be applied to today's scientific breakthroughs, to ensure that the values we all hold dear - not just the values of a few - will guide us into the new frontier. In four thematically structured chapters, in which Harding connects her historical examples to current considerations about AI, the author argues that AI should be peaceful in its intent, embrace limitations, serve purpose not profit, and be rooted in societal trust. History tells us that we can imbue AI with a deep intentionality that aligns with our best and brightest ideals, interests, and values and that serves the public good - but, to make this happen, the public must take part in this conversation""--";"Princeton : Princeton University Press, 2024.

289141;"How sanctions work : Iran and the impact of economic warfare /";"Bajoghli, Narges,";"""Sanctions have enormous consequences. Especially when imposed by a country with the economic influence of the United States, sanctions induce clear shockwaves in both the economy and political culture of the targeted state, and in the everyday lives of citizens. But do economic sanctions induce the behavioral changes intended? Do sanctions work in the way they should ? To answer these questions, the authors of How Sanctions Work highlight Iran, the most sanctioned country in the world. Comprehensive sanctions are meant to induce uprisings or pressures to change the behavior of the ruling establishment, or to weaken its hold on power. But, after four decades, the case of Iran shows the opposite to be true: sanctions strengthened the Iranian state, impoverished its population, increased state repression, and escalated Iran's military posture toward the U.S. and its allies in the region. Instead of offering an 'alternative to war,' sanctions have become a cause of war. Consequently, this book reveals how necessary it is to understand how sanctions really work""--";"Stanford, California : Stanford University Press, 2024.

His mole hunts have led to the unmasking of spies within MI5, MI6 and the CIA and the identification of numerous others - some of whom were crucial to the Allied victory in the Second World War and would have died without any public recognition if not for him. His first encounter with the intelligence community was a lecture given at his school by John le Carré, the guest of a Benedictine monk who had recently retired from MI6. Later, West worked as a researcher for SOE agent Ronnie Seth, who was sentenced to death by the Nazis after being captured during Operation blunderhead, and exposed two of the Cambridge spies recruited by Anthony Blunt. For the fortieth anniversary of the D-Day landings, West traced the double agent codenamed garbo and brought him to London so he could be decorated at Buckingham Palace. As action-packed as the lives of the spies he has written about, this is the story of the most enthralling and significant post-war intelligence revelations as told by Britain's most authoritative writer on espionage and the secret services.";"London : Biteback Publishing Ltd, 2024.

In the decades after the collapse of Soviet communism, the West convinced itself that liberal democracy would henceforth be the dominant, ultimately unique, system of governance - a hubris that shaped how the West would treat Russia for the next two decades. But history wasn't over. Putin is a paradox. In the early years of his presidency, he appeared to commit himself to friendship with the West, suggesting that Russia could join the European Union or even NATO. He said he supported free-market democracy and civil rights. But the Putin of those years is unrecognisable today. The Putin of the 2020s is an autocratic nationalist, dedicated to repression at home and anti-Western militarism abroad. So, what happened? Was he lying when he proclaimed his support for freedom, democracy and friendship with the West? Or, was he sincere? Did he change his views at some stage between then and now? And if that is the case, what happened to change him?Putin and the Return of History examines these questions in the context of Russia's thousand-year past, tracing the forces and the myths that have shaped Putin's politics of aggression: the enduring terror of encirclement by outsiders, the subjugation of the individual to the cause of the state, the collectivist values that allow the sacrifice of human lives in battle, the willingness to lie and deceive, the co-opting of religion and the belief in Great Russia's mission to change the world.";"London ; New York : Bloomsbury Continuum, 2024 ";"Introduction -- Separate ways -- Not with a bang -- Zlost' -- Broken promises? -- NATO's final solution? -- The Great Patriot War; chosen glory and historical truth -- Versailles, Weimar, and Russophobia -- Shared past, divergent presents -- Memory wars -- Euromaiden and the president's fears of revolution -- Crimea and territorial memory -- Donbas-Kyiv and Moscow's problem child -- The Putin paradox and the hollow regime -- Holy war -- Countdown to conflict -- Resistance, denial, and disinformation -- A crisis of liberal democracy -- Conclusion  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289145

India's economy has overtaken the United Kingdom's to become the fifth-largest in the world, but it is still only one-fifth the size of China's, and India's economic growth is too slow to provide jobs for millions of its ambitious youth. Blocking India's current path are intense global competition in low-skilled manufacturing, increasing protectionism and automation, and the country's majoritarian streak in politics. In Breaking the Mold, Raghuram Rajan and Rohit Lamba show why and how India needs to blaze a new path if it's to succeed. India diverged long ago from the standard development model, the one followed by China--from agriculture to low-skilled manufacturing, then high-skilled manufacturing and, finally, services--by leapfrogging intermediate steps. India must not turn back now. Rajan and Lamba explain how India can accelerate growth by prioritizing human capital, expanding opportunities in high-skilled services, encouraging entrepreneurship, and strengthening rather than weakening its democratic traditions. It can chart a path based on ideas and creativity even at its early stage of development.

The lessons of negotiating arms control in the first nuclear age during the Cold War have faded from memory, and the nonproliferation and disarmament instruments that were developed under post-Cold War US hegemony in the second nuclear age are ill suited to the future. David A. Cooper proposes relearning, reviving, and adapting classic arms control theory and negotiating practices to steer the world away from dangerous and destabilizing nuclear arms races.

Looking at flashpoints in Iranian, Egyptian, Syrian, and Lebanese history, Fawaz A. Gerges shows how postwar U.S. leaders made a devil’s pact with potentates, autocrats, and strongmen around the world. Washington sought to tame assertive nationalists and to protect repressive Middle Eastern regimes in return for compliance with American hegemonic designs and uninterrupted flows of cheap oil. The book takes a counterfactual approach, asking readers to consider how the political trajectories of these countries and, by extension, the entire region may have differed had U.S. foreign policy privileged the nationalist aspirations of patriotic and independent Middle Eastern leaders and people. Gerges argues that rather than focusing on rolling back communism, extracting oil, and pursuing interventionist and imperial policies in Iran, Egypt, and beyond, postwar U.S. leaders should have allowed the Middle East greater autonomy in charting its own political and economic development. In so doing, the contemporary Middle East may have had better prospects for stability, prosperity, peace, and democracy. --";"New Haven ; London : Yale University Press, 2024 ";"INTRODUCTION: Narrating History .-- CHAPTER 1.

289518;"AI, sacred violence, and war : the case of Gaza /";"Gray, Chris Hables.";"This open access book is about how Israel is using Algorithmic Intelligence (AI) and other computer technology in military operations in the Gaza Strip to achieve goals based on ancient religious entitlements. Changes in Israel Defense Force (IDF) ethical codes and innovation policies have not led to victory, but have resulted in a wide range of War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in a strategy focused on The Torture of Gaza, which includes ethnic cleansing and is approaching genocide. It covers the history of using AI in war, and current U.S. and Israeli military AI technologies such as Maven, Iron Dome, Pegasus, the Alchemist, Gospel, Lavender, and Where's Daddy, all tested and perfected in the Palestinian Laboratory and marketed as such. This book also places the current data-driven and AI-directed assault on Palestine in the context of Postmodern War, which precludes military victories and enshrines the profits and power of the U.S.-Israeli military-industrial complex in a system of perpetual war and militarized technological innovation. Through an analysis of Israeli military policies, AI, sacred texts, and the basic tenets of postmodern war, the book ultimately reveals the limits of the IDF's embrace of illusions about new technologies producing actual victory. War today is about winning hearts and minds, not body counts. As fundamentalist politics achieve more and more power around the world in the context of new information technologies, there is growing danger to the future of all of us.

It introduces a set of concrete examples demonstrating the relevance of SEPLS to aspects of reciprocal connections between business and biodiversity. The case studies highlight the roles, attitudes, motivations, and actions of multiple stakeholders in conserving biodiversity while providing other benefits that directly or indirectly contribute to businesses. They also illustrate on-the-ground impacts of businesses in SEPLS - including positive and negative ones, providing insights on how to categorize and measure the impacts and dependency of businesses on biodiversity and nature's contributions to people. This will help facilitate policy learning and evidence-based decision-making to promote the achievement of global goals including the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Many of the case studies concerning SEPLS management derived from the International Partnership for the Satoyama Initiative (IPSI) provide rich evidence to detail and help clarify the interdependency between businesses and biodiversity while exemplifying innovative solutions to facilitate more sustainable business decisions and actions for socially and ecologically sound outcomes. Furthermore, the experiences in managing SEPLS where multiple actors negotiate and collaborate to meet diverse needs and interests provide practical insights on the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders and how to build partnerships to promote systemic changes towards sustainable futures. The book provides key messages derived from a synthesis of the case study findings, which will help stakeholders including policymakers, scientists, and practitioners to deepen the understanding of reciprocal connections between business and biodiversity and clarify challenges and opportunities for promoting more sustainable businesses and at the same time safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems. This in turn will help further the science-policy-practice interfaces related to biodiversity, ecosystem services, and sustainable development.

289528;"Service innovation and management : digitalization, service infusion and customer experience /";"Witell, Lars.";"This open access book investigates how digitalization and service infusion are changing service provision and the customer experience. It highlights the central role of service management and service innovation in making these changes not only appear in theory but also implementing them in business practice. At the beginning of the 21st century, many manufacturing firms struggled to exploit the financial potential of service businesses, a phenomenon described as the service paradox. While many manufacturing firms are still struggling with this paradox, several firms (both service and manufacturing firms) are simultaneously struggling with digitalization. This phenomenon can be viewed as the digitalization paradox, i.e., as a situation in which companies invest in digitalization but struggle to reach the expected revenue growth. By applying the lens of service innovation to digitalization and service infusion, the book showcases how firms can overcome the service and digitalization paradoxes, transform service provision, and improve the customer experience. It offers comprehensive coverage, blending literature reviews, conceptualizations, empirical illustrations, and case studies to offer a multifaceted perspective on corporate strategies, illuminating pathways to address the challenges posed by the service and digitalization paradoxes. Built on the latest research from the CTF - Service Research Center at Karlstad University, Sweden, this book offers a valuable resource for managers seeking practical strategies and approaches to enhance their understanding and implementation of service management and marketing principles. It will also appeal to academics with an interest in service management and marketing.

However, the first robots that are used in care, service and education are already being sold commercially. The contributors grapple with methodological challenges in investigating communicative AI systems in (inter-)action. They investigate how these studies can be composed and what kinds of insights such research can provide. With this, the anthology brings together contributions from a growing community of researchers who are committed to exploring communicative AI »in (inter-)action« by using and adapting qualitative (and mostly ethnographic) methods.

289530;"Data protection and information privacy : perceptions across cultures /";"Thir, Veronika.";"The impact of cultural factors on perceptions of and attitudes toward privacy is often neglected in privacy studies. Yet, understanding these factors is crucial in our globalized world, where businesses, governments and researchers rely on data from different cultures. This book makes a contribution to closing this gap. It presents and discusses findings from a large, comparative cross-cultural study on professionals' views of key data protection and information privacy issues, such as data autonomy, the data power of companies and governments, and the impact of data protection and information privacy regulations on companies, consumers, and the state. The book facilitates a better understanding of attitudes toward data protection and privacy across cultures by highlighting areas in which professionals around the world are (dis-)satisfied with data protection regulations and practices, and showing how culture-specific factors can help to explain differences in this area.

289531;"3D research challenges in cultural heritage V : paradata, metadata and data in digitisation /";"Ioannides, Marinos.";"This open access book presents a collection of papers focussing on 3D digitisation in the domain of cultural heritage. The use of data acquisition technologies in digitising cultural heritage holds great potential for preserving and disseminating the history of mankind. However, to exploit these opportunities in full, comprehensive guidelines for documenting the process of digitisation are required. Only then can the efficiency and credibility of digital representations be assured. A major focus of the 16 papers included in this State-of-the-Art Survey is on all aspects of the documentation of the digitisation process, i.e., the paradata, which, alongside the metadata, is critical to the scientific rigour, replicability and sustainability of digital heritage resources. The volume provides a useful resource for computer scientists, surveyors, archaeologists, architects, museologists and engineers.

CBL democratises the process of learning by repositioning students as drivers, who are empowered to make decisions on course content, assess needs in the real world and develop opinions. Teachers monitor student learning and engagement and mentor students to express their needs. Chapters showcase existing CBL practices in different settings, and include case studies which detail the practical application of CBL in multiple contexts. The authors develop an emerging theory of practical learning based on the insights of the curriculum designers, practitioners and students. The book will be of interest to researchers, teacher educators/trainers and research supervisors in higher education.

289535;"The formation of Japan-ROK security relations : meeting the evolving Cold War challenge /";"Choi, Kyungwon.";"This open access book argues that Japan-ROK security relations were formed in the process of adjusting the threat perception gap and policy conflict between the two countries. Conventional analyses using a ""cooperation or conflict"" dichotomy are too limited to capture the complex coordination of interests that security relations entail. In comparison, this book focuses on how, as they interacted on security concerns, Japan and the ROK had different threat perceptions and foreign policy orientations that resulted in friction over the means and methods of responses and shines a light on the changes apparent in the adjustment process. The author aims to elucidate how Japan and the ROK approached security cooperation over the period from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s. As Japan and the ROK looked to reconcile the differing political positions involved in these security and détente requirements, they explored and began to show new developments in bilateral security cooperation. This book provides a new perspective on Japan-ROK security relations and through this lens a broader view of international relations in East Asia. It also proves useful in understanding bilateral cooperation in the security field following the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

289516;"Brunei Darussalam's economic transition in a shifting global Asia / ";"Khalid, Ahmed M.";"This is an Open Access book. The international political economy is confronted by a number of overlapping crises. These include the climate emergency, rapid technological advancement, the high volume of globalised trade and financial flows, cross-border labour movement, rising inequality, geopolitical tensions, and frequent economic crises and natural disasters. Many developing countries are going through a period of urgent transformation and transition to adopt new policies to cope with such challenges and achieve and maintain sustainable and inclusive socioeconomic development. This path-breaking volume explores the issues shaping the response of Brunei Darussalam, long dependent on its oil and gas sector, to these challenges. The discussions presented here are framed by the notion of 'development in transition'--a mix of well-designed policies driven by timely implementation, enforcement and monitoring, as well as international cooperation to ensure sustainable development and distribution of benefits on an equitable basis. Through fine-grained analyses of key economic sectors--including natural resources, employment patterns, financial services, global value chains, international trade, tourism and the role of the public sector--the contributors offer a critical assessment of Brunei's policy responses. This transitional policy mix is situated in relation to the overarching development strategy called Wawasan Brunei 2035 (Brunei Vision 2035), which broadly maps onto the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. Academic scholars, university students and others interested in the study of contemporary Brunei and broader questions of economic transition in Asia will find this volume an invaluable resource for a deeper understanding of how development paths and priorities are being managed to meet pressing global and local challenges.

289517;"Assessing feasibility with value-laden models : discussing the normativity of integrated assessment models /";"Hollnaicher, Simon.";"In this Open-Access-book, the author investigates the value dimension of Integrated Assessment Models and their application to questions of feasibility. Integrated models provide a quantified representation of the interaction between the socio-economic system with the climate and serve as a pivotal tool at the intersection of climate science, policymakers, and society. This book critically examines how IAMs approach the concept of feasibility. It unpacks the value assumptions embedded within integrated modeling, critiques the implicit normativity of these models, and proposes principles for responsibly managing value judgments in scientific advice. Arguing for a thick conception of feasibility--one that integrates key normative dimensions--it highlights the gap between conceptual discussions of feasibility and the scientific practices that inform feasibility assessments. Addressed to both philosophers and integrated modelers, this book sheds light on the implicit values shaping our collective visions for the future.

289603;"The South China Sea : the Geo-Political Epicenter of the Indo-Pacific? /";;"This open access book focuses on the geopolitical competition in the South China Sea, an area with highly concentrated choke points in the Indo-Pacific, presenting ideas and recommendations to manage this competition and foster cooperation to maintain a peaceful and stable environment and promote sustainable governance of the South China Sea and of the Indo-Pacific in a broader sense. The increasingly complex geopolitics of the Indo-Pacific has made the South China Sea the epicenter of strategic competition between the great powers, with a rising China on the one hand and the United States, its allies, and partners on the other. In this strategic chessboard, the South China Sea is a test of resilience of the rules-based international order, such as versus grey zone operations, as well as disruptive technological developments in both traditional and non-traditional domains. The book incorporates foreign policy analysis methods to analyze and forecast key players' goals, intentions, and behaviors within the competitive strategic environment of the South China Sea. The success or failure of managing major power competition in the South China Sea, one of the hot spots of the Indo-Pacific region, will determine the future structure of international relations. In addition, as a dynamically developing region of the world, promoting collaborative ideas, particularly in areas related to conflict management is essential for maintaining a peaceful and stable environment, restoring economic growth, and progressing toward a sustainable future. This book is of interest to politicians, policy-makers, experts, scholars, researchers, and other readers who are interested in how regional issues can shape the global order.";"Singapore : Springer, 2025.

289602;"The Nexus Between Legal Pluralism and Inclusive Finance : Insights from Ethiopia and South Africa /";"Yimer, Gebreyesus,";"This open access book provides detailed information on informal credit markets in Africa and how various legal systems affect these markets. Laws that impose strict formalism exclude many people from the financial system. The lessons learned from the informal credit markets in Ethiopia and South Africa indicate that pluralism offers better opportunities for people to access affordable and sustainable financial services. Inclusive legal systems promote inclusive financial systems. Therefore, international development organisations, financial institutions, international financial policymakers and standard setters should embrace pluralism to foster sustainable, inclusive and equitable financial systems. Pluralism recognises local innovation and creativity, which are vital for inclusive financial systems to flourish. In developing countries, many people who have no or only limited access to the services of official financial institutions often depend on informal credit markets. National law is the most critical element in terms of determining the operations of informal credit markets, defining the boundaries between formal and informal markets, and shaping the consequences of involvement in informal credit markets. This book will interest researchers, scholars, and students in the fields of legal theory, law and society, law and anthropology, legal pluralism, law and culture, and African law. However, its relevance extends beyond academia, offering policymakers involved in inclusive finance, law and development, and financial regulation in developing countries valuable insights and perspectives to inform their decisions and strategies.";"Cham : Springer, 2024.

In the wake of George W. Bush's declaration of a ""global war on terror"" in 2001, Islamists have often been associated with violence, opposition to liberal values, and the disruption of order. However, a closer examination reveals that only a fraction of the groups categorised as ""Islamist"" genuinely combat the global order. Through an in-depth analysis of the discourses of Tunisian Ennahda and Lebanese Hezbollah, this book demonstrates that Islamist stances toward the world order involve a delicate balance between resistance to certain aspects of the Western-dominated order and recognition of others.";"Edinburgh : Edinburgh University Press, 2024.

As the governance and regulation of sport are seen as illustrations of other forms of normativity, this book also contributes to the conversation about the transnational dimension of law and legal orders. In this respect, it illustrates that normative autonomy in the field of sport, associated with the idea of lex sportiva, tends to be relative regarding IHRL. The sporting environment is not disconnected from major contemporary social issues: it constitutes a public space in which injustices can be denounced, but also the theater in which prejudices are perpetuated against various parties, such as athletes or workers. IHRL commonly addresses attacks on individual dignity and social justice issues by guaranteeing rights to individuals and offering them protection mechanisms.

Passing through Enclosures and Reversing Inequalities through Educational Commons. The overall objective of the project was to understand, develop, and accelerate the potential impact of education on reversing inequalities for active social inclusion of children and young people at risk in Europe, through introducing the emergent paradigm of the “commons” as an alternative value and action system in the field of education (preschools, schools, and after-school programs). SMOOTH critically draws out the implications of the commons for refiguring education and for social change in general, on a footing of equality, sharing, participation, togetherness, caring, and freedom. Universities, research laboratories, municipalities, NGOs, museums, and youth organizations, in different European countries, have worked together to achieve the above aim involving almost 200 educators and teachers, and 800 children, and providing interesting insights and suggestions on how to implement educational commons in many different educational contexts.

289588;"Decentralization, Local Governance, and Inequality in the Middle East and North Africa / ";;"While many scholars, policymakers, and development practitioners view decentralization as a way to increase participation, strengthen political representation, and improve social welfare, little is known about the experiences of communities in the context of decentralization - particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. This volume directs our attention toward the ways in which decentralization is ""lived locally"" by citizens of the MENA region, underscoring the simultaneous influences of individual-level factors (e.g., gender, education) and local context (e.g., development levels, electoral institutions) on governance processes and outcomes. A group of international scholars brings together methodologically diverse, original research in Lebanon, Morocco, Syria, and Tunisia to expand the literature on decentralization. Following a preface by Hicham Alaoui, the empirical chapters are arranged into three thematic sections. These focus on subnational variations in the relationships between central and local actors, citizen engagement with state and non-state institutions, and the extent to which representatives reflect their local communities. Together, these chapters provide important insights into governance, participation, and representation in the MENA and open new questions for furthering the study of governance and local development. Only by unpacking perspectives and governance experiences at the micro-level can we understand how decentralization policies affect citizens' everyday lives.";"Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2025.

289754;"Mapping European security after Kosovo / ";;"This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. In the story of post-Cold War conceptual confusion, the war in and over Kosovo stands out as a particularly interesting episode. This book provides new and stimulating perspectives on how Kosovo has shaped the new Europe. It breaks down traditional assumptions in the field of security studies by sidelining the theoretical worldview that underlies mainstream strategic thinking on recent events in Kosovo. The book offers a conceptual overview of the Kosovo debate, placing these events in the context of globalisation, European integration and the discourse of modernity and its aftermath. It then examines Kosovo's impact on the idea of war. One of the great paradoxes of the war in Kosovo was that it was not just one campaign but two: there was the ethnic cleansing campaign in Kosovo and the allied bombing campaign against targets in Kosovo and all over Serbia. Serbia's killing of Kosovo has set the parameters of the Balkanisation-integration nexus, offering 'Europe' (and the West in general) a unique opportunity to suggest itself as the strong centre that keeps the margins from running away. Next, it investigates 'Kosovo' as a product of the decay of modern institutions and discourses like sovereignty, statehood, the warring state or the United Nations system. 'Kosovo' has introduced new overtones into the European Weltanschauung and the ways in which 'Europe' asserts itself as an independent power discourse in a globalising world: increasingly diffident, looking for firm foundations in the conceptual void of the turn of the century.";"Manchester :  Manchester University Press,  [2018] ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289754

The role of the Congress is essential to any study of American government and politics. It would be impossible to gain a complete understanding of the American system of government without an appreciation of the nature and workings of this essential body. This text looks at the workings of the United States Congress, and uses the Republican period of ascendancy, which lasted from 1994 until 2000, as an example of how the Congress works in practice. The book illustrates the basic principles of Congress using contemporary and recent examples, while also drawing attention to the changes that took place in the 1990s. The period of Republican control is absent from many of the standard texts and is of considerable academic interest for a number of reasons, not least the 1994 election, the budget deadlock in 1995 and the Clinton impeachment scandal of 1999.

289757;"The Conservatives in crisis / ";;"This electronic version has been made available under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-ND) open access license. The Conservative Party's survival as a significant political force was now open to serious question for the first time since the crisis over the Corn Laws. The Labour Party has commanded a fairly consistent level of attention, whether in office or in opposition. But it seems that the Conservatives are fated to be regarded either as unavoidable or irrelevant. This book presents an analysis that suggests that the party leader plays a less important role in Conservative recoveries than a distinctive policy programme and an effective party organization. It examines the Conservative position on a series of key issues, highlighting the difficult dilemmas which confronted the party after 1997, notably on economic policy. New Labour's acceptance of much of the main thrust of Thatcherite economic policy threw the Conservatives off balance. The pragmatism of this new position and the 'In Europe, not run by Europe' platform masked a significant move towards Euro-skepticism. The book also traces how the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Parties adapted to the creation of the Scottish Parliament, exploring the re-organisation of the Scottish party, its electoral fortunes and political prospects in the new Scottish politics. It examines issues of identity and nationhood in Conservative politics in the 1997-2001 period, focusing on the 'English Question' and the politics of 'race'. The predictable results of the Conservatives' failure to develop an attractive, consistent narrative are then analysed. Right-wing populist parties with charismatic leaders enjoyed some electoral success under the proportional representation systems in 2002.";"Manchester :  Manchester University Press,  [2018] ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289757

It focuses on Turkey's achievement in halting and minimising the effects of the temporary devaluation in its strategic importance that resulted from the waning of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the skilful way in which Turkey avoided becoming embroiled in the ethnic upheavals in Central Asia, the Balkans and the Middle East, and the development of a continued policy of closer integration into the European and western worlds.Internal politics are the focus of the second part of the book, addressing the curbing of the Kurdish revolt, the economic gains made, and the strengthening of civil society.

Drawing upon egalitarian, feminist and environmental ideas, the book proposes that the social democratic tradition can be renewed but only if the dominance of conservative ideas is challenged more effectively.

This debate lies at the interface between two largely independent disciplines, economics and sociology, and reflects an attempt to bring the two fields of discourse more closely together. This book explores this interface in a number of ways, looking at the competitive process and market relations from a number of different perspectives. It includes a wide range of contributors, most of whom are leading writers and thinkers in the field.The book considers the social role of economic institutions in society and examines the various meanings embedded in the word 'markets', as well as developing arguments on the nature of competition as an instituted economic process, rather than as competition being something that disturbs norms or institutions. It goes on to consider the deeper and more involved connection between markets and cognition, explaining how institutions can ease cognitive difficulties, and the effect of culture on markets and competition is also fully studied.This book will be of vital use to students and academics working in the fields of economics, sociology and business studies. It sketches the agenda for future research about markets and the competitive process.";"Manchester :  Manchester University Press,  [2018] ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289765

This study reveals that most exiles were on British soil by chance rather than by design, and that many were not sure whether to stay. Overlooked by historians, who have concentrated on the 'Free French' of de Gaulle, these were the 'Forgotten French': refugees swept off the beaches of Dunkirk; servicemen held in camps after the Franco-German armistice; Vichy consular officials left to cater for their compatriots; and a sizeable colonist community based mainly in London.

289870;"Disability inclusion in humanitarian crises : robust human rights norms? /";"Funke, Carolin.";"This open access book studies disability inclusion in humanitarian crises. It addresses the challenges of recognizing and including persons with disabilities and indicates the degree to which disability is being mainstreamed in international law and humanitarian action. Further, it explores how international organizations have promoted a rights-based understanding of disability in international law, and to what extent this understanding has gained acceptance in humanitarian policy and practice. Theoretically, Funke and Dijkzeul explore the robustness of the disability inclusion norm cluster during processes of institutionalization, translation, and implementation. The book examines these processes from a multi-level perspective, which involves a variety of actors beyond states, including organizations of persons with disabilities. Situating their analysis within the literature on humanitarian action and development, the authors argue for an increased focus on processes ""below"" the international level in international relations and international law scholarship to better understand disability inclusion.";"Cham : Palgrave Macmillan, 2025.

How could this rebellion of comparatively small players against the militarily most powerful states in the world succeed? The answer lies in the formation of an alliance of non-nuclear weapon states and civil society using subversive techniques to counter the discursive and procedural dominance of nuclear weapon states. This resistance was also partially motivated by anti-colonialism. With his analysis, Sascha Hach reveals patterns of exercising power in international relations, the functioning of the nuclear order, and creative methods of success in resistance.";"Bielefeld : transcript Verlag, 2025.

289875;"The Terrorism News Beat :  Professionalism, Profit, and the Press / ";"Hoffman, Aaron M.";"Critics of terrorism news coverage often describe it as a sensationalized and intimidating area of reporting. However, this characterization offers a misleading guide to the coverage of terrorist threats and attacks, counterterrorism, and community responses to terrorism that appears in U.S. newspapers. Counterterrorism--not terrorist threats or attacks--is the most reported-on subject in newspapers such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. Rather than focusing on accounts of terrorist attacks, militarized counterterrorism, or counterterrorism failures, journalists more often cover counterterrorism successes, criminal justice, and diplomatic or community responses to terrorism.  The Terrorism News Beat engages thinking about terrorism and the news media from the fields of political science, communication, criminology, economics, and sociology using multimethod research involving more than 2,500 newspaper articles published between 1997 and 2018. Chapters analyze the terrorism news beat's subject matter, language, and coverage of the Oklahoma City Bombing, Olympic Park bombing, 9/11 attacks, DC Sniper case, and Dallas Police shooting. When it comes to language use, Hoffman finds that, rather than giving into the temptation to convey the news in lurid detail, journalists are minimalists. The language used to depict events on the terrorism beat is typically moderate and extreme words like ""torture"" appear only as necessary. The Terrorism News Beat shows that contrary to claims of sensationalism, the tone of terrorism coverage becomes even more sober during terrorism crises than it is during non-crisis periods and meets journalistic standards for quality.";"Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2025.

289876;"User Experience + Artificial Intelligence :  Assessing the Qualities of AI-Infused Systems / ";"Spallazzo, Davide.";"This open access book addresses the thriving trend of embedding artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) capabilities in products and services reaching the lay public, focusing on the user experience (UX) they prompt from a designerly perspective. It offers a UX evaluation method designed explicitly for AI-infused systems to answer one of the core problems affecting the relationship and interactions people have with such artefacts. The work investigates how people perceive and make sense of systems integrating AI capabilities, trying to understand how their meaning and significance can affect the experience of such products and what design challenges may arise. Given the fundamental premise that current UX methods cannot address AI-infused artefacts, it introduces the results of Meet-AI, a research project exploring specific ways to tackle these problems. The book then presents a comprehensive analysis of current UX methods, and a literature review focused on detecting possible gaps and the most suitable qualities to describe AI-infused systems, and summarizes the findings from all previous investigations into a UX evaluation scale: AIXE (AI user eXperience Evaluation). The book also portrays how the tool has been validated and expanded to become a more comprehensive method. It further describes how the scale has been applied to a comparative study of domestic smart speakers, and introduces a reversed interpretation of the outcomes, framing them as heuristics to inform the early phases of the design process and paving the way for future experimentations in the meta-design dimension.";"Cham : Springer, 2025.

This open access book focuses on ADR mechanisms in one specific geographical region: the Western Balkans. This region comprises Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Serbia. Although these countries generally have legal frameworks for ADR mechanisms in place, they remain largely underutilised in practice. Promoting ADR mechanisms in the countries of the Western Balkans could make them more attractive to foreign investors, thereby fostering economic growth. Additionally, the effective implementation of ADR mechanisms could have spill-over effects on national judiciaries, thereby increasing domestic rule of law standards. This would be highly beneficial for the Western Balkan countries, most of which are still aspiring to become Member States of the European Union (EU). To achieve this, they are required to promote the use of ADR mechanisms and align their legal frameworks with EU standards.";"Cham : Springer, 2025.

At a moment where ocean governance is a pressing topic amongst academics, policy makers, governments and non- governmental agencies alike, this book takes on one of the most overlooked but central devices underscoring many modes of oceanic management: the border. Uniquely combining contemporary border scholarship with cutting edge ocean governance research this book tackles themes ranging from biodiversity conservation and asylum regulations to shipping management measures, tourism, and the growing blue economy. This edited volume hence explores varied bordering practices, whilst also addressing the 'common-senseness' with which bordering is deployed at sea, questioning - and problematising - its function and efficacy. Throughout 12 carefully curated chapters, authors ask: What borders are present in the seas and oceans, where and why? In doing this the book offers readers a simple provocation: Do we need borders? And can we govern differently?";"Cham : Palgrave Macmillan, 2025. ";"  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=289928
289926;"Metamodeling for Extended Reality / ";"Muff, Fabian,";"This open access book which is based on the author's dissertation in 2024 explores the challenges of metamodeling in the context of extended reality and emphasizes the need for new concepts in metamodeling to effectively combine it with extended reality technologies. The central question of this work is how metamodeling can be used ""in"" and ""for"" extended reality. The book is structured in nine chapters: Chapter 1 introduces the topic by providing background information and outlining the research objectives, questions, methodology and structure. Chapter 2 delves into the existing literature and developments in the field. It covers various aspects of modeling, such as conceptual, enterprise, and metamodeling, as well as extended reality (XR), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and the metaverse. Next, chapter 3 presents the generic requirements for metamodeling for augmented and virtual reality by systematically deriving use cases for joining AR and metamodeling. Chapter 4 then identifies specific requirements for integrating metamodeling with XR, such as coordinate mappings, visualization of model components, detection and tracking, context, or interaction. Subsequently, chapter 5 introduces a new domain-specific visual modeling language for creating augmented reality scenarios, particularly within the context of metamodeling, before chapter 6 outlines the conceptualization and design of a 3D enhanced metamodeling platform considering extended reality, detailing its structure, components, and the interconnection of its elements. Chapter 7 then presents the initial implementation of the various components of this modeling platform, and chapter 8 evaluates the newly introduced platform both theoretically and empirically. Eventually, chapter 9 concludes the book by an alignment with the initial research questions, discussing limitations, and provides a final summary and an outlook for further research. This book mainly aims at researchers in conceptual modeling, especially in projects related to XR, VR, or AR, as the presented new domain-specific modeling method for creating workflows for XR/VR/AR applications does not assume specific prior programming knowledge.";"Cham : Springer, 2025.

While there is already a vast amount of literature on immigration, it often focuses on issues such as human rights, citizenship, and social integration, reflecting the contemporary interests of Western countries. However, as long as the most fundamental norm of international politics remains the mutual recognition of exclusive jurisdictional rights over territory by sovereign states, people crossing borders pose various challenges to this system of sovereign states. It is this awareness of the issue that makes this book unique. This book examines the implications of the movement of people across national borders both for the state and for international politics. From the standpoint of international politics, the focus of the examination is the international political meaning of the transnational phenomenon of the movement of people. This is an interest that extends from the study of international political economy, which questions the significance for international politics of the transnational phenomena of international trade and international finance.";"Singapore : Springer, 2025.

It argues for a shift from individualism to group-focused economic theory and policy, revealing that historical financial accumulation stemmed from collective rather than individual actions. To combat detrimental herd behavior, the book advocates for methodological groupism in economic policies. This shift promises more resilient financial flows, ensuring widespread societal benefits and mitigating harm to the global ecosystem. Through data analysis of capital and labor earnings in the US, UK, France, and Italy, and the introduction of ""sustainable earnings trends,"" the book provides actionable insights applicable from local to international levels, using the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guiding framework. This makes the book a must-read for scholars, researchers, and students of environmental economics, sustainability, labor economics, finance, public policy, and governance, as well as policymakers seeking profound insights into the future of sustainable economics and finance.";"Cham : Springer, 2025.

289921;"EU and Russian Hegemony in the 'Shared Neighbourhood' : Between Coercion, Prescription, and Co-Optation /";"Burmester, Isabell,";"This open access book examines the EU's and Russia's policies in Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus through the prism of hegemony, a concept that it applies to both regional actors. The study cross fertilises the literatures on the EU neighbourhood policy, Russia's foreign policy, and the scholarship on power in international relations to arrive at an innovative conceptualisation of the mechanisms of hegemonic power. The comparative lens of the analysis leads to novel findings that advance our understanding of the EU's and Russia's behaviour in the EU's Eastern neighbourhood.  In this book, the existing, separate theorisations are subsumed under more generic terms and concepts, thereby rendering EU and Russian modes of influence comparable for empirical analysis. The comprehensive conceptual framework of hegemonic power in shared neighbourhoods is based on three ideal typical mechanisms of hegemonic influence: coercion, prescription, and co-optation. To understand the nature of EU and Russian hegemony in the region, the uses of the three mechanisms by Russia and the EU towards two neighbourhood countries are compared. The focus is laid on EU and Russian actions towards Moldova and Armenia since the beginning of the 2000s and the local perceptions of these actions. Thus, the comparative case study provides insights into the longer developments in this regional order that led to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The book is intended for scholars and students interested in understanding the broader context of Russia's war in Ukraine. Because of its contribution to the debate on regional powers in shared neighbourhoods, it is particularly useful for researchers analysing the (changing) power dynamics and hegemonic behaviour in this regional order. Furthermore, it offers other scholars an analytical framework to work with when analysing the policies of different regional powers.";"Cham : Palgrave Macmillan, 2025.

With this, it touches upon important questions in the innovation agenda of countries across continents about the ethics, justice, quality, responsibility, accountability, and transparency to use AI for state functions. The volume shows that in many countries, AI, or at least data analytics methods, are already in place to support the assessment of beneficiaries for deciding on the value criteria to distinguish between legal /fraudulent, deserving/non-deserving, or needy/non-needy recipients. The book provides a cross-cultural comparison of AI-based social assessment among national welfare systems of 9 countries across 4 continents: Spain, Estonia, Germany, Iran, India, Nigeria, Ukraine, China and USA. Based on participatory research results from multi-stakeholder inputs, especially those from vulnerable groups, the chapters in this volume show that value criteria for fairness and social justice are context-bound and vary across the globe. Furthermore, they are in constant flux, aligned to social change. Thus, the volume looks at pathways to developing culture-sensitive, responsive and participatory AI for social assessment in public service provision. The contributions are interdisciplinary and introduce perspectives from the fields of sociology, computational social science, computer science and public policy.

It provides new insights into four main areas: (1) It highlights international experiences in CBC to identify best practices for Central Asian states; (2) it discusses various policies of Central Asian states towards CBC, specifically those policies that impact Central Asian CBC either positively or negatively; (3) it identifies best practices and actors for successful CBC in Central Asia, including the role of non-governmental entities; (4) it provides recommendations for enhancing Central Asian CBC, drawing upon both international experiences and a thorough analysis of Central Asian contexts. The authors proceed from the assumption that effective cross-border cooperation is one of the essential conditions for successful regional integration, as it acts as a connective seam between participating states. Unfortunately, at present, no Central Asian country excels in CBC; in every case, CBC is impeded by highly centralized political systems, and lack of funding. To enhance CBC in Central Asia, it is crucial to examine the relevant experiences of other countries and regions, incorporating lessons from both successful and unsuccessful endeavors.";"Cham : Springer, 2025.

289914;"Cosmopolitan Imaginaries and International Disorder / ";"McKeil, Aaron C.,";"While the idea of a cosmopolitan order embracing all humankind is ancient, after the Cold War it was widely believed to be an emerging future. As global interdependence and interaction through new technologies increased, literature of cosmopolitan globalization argued that these changes were setting the stage for a structural transformation of world politics. Yet, a revolt against globalism and increasingly divisive and unstable international order has dramatically contradicted this idea. This presents a puzzle for International Relations theory: Why have attempts to construct cosmopolitan order struggled to emerge in the modern global world? Cosmopolitan Imaginaries and International Disorder argues that advocacy for cosmopolitan order reform in the modern world has struggled to recognize the political identities of states and populations and to legitimize its proposed political hierarchies. As a result, these efforts have been overwhelmed by states shoring up their power and remobilizing exclusionary nationalist identities, especially when struggles are intensified in contexts of international instability and economic turmoil. In developing a theory to explain these patterns of cosmopolitan politics, this book offers insight into the limits and role of cosmopolitanism in a dividing international order after liberal globalism.";"Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2025.

289913;"No Peer Rivals : American Grand Strategy in the Era of Great Power Competition /";"Popescu, Ionut C.,";"With military maneuvers in Taiwan and the South China Sea and the eruption of war in Ukraine, the past few years have brought deteriorating diplomatic relations and increasing military and economic tensions between the United States, China, and Russia. After benefiting from the geopolitical and financial advantages conferred by a privileged status as a global superpower for three decades, the United States needs to adapt to a geopolitical shift toward competition and confrontation in order to contain China's quest for global superpower status. No Peer Rivals takes a major staple of International Relations scholarship--the offensive realist paradigm--and develops a comprehensive and practical grand strategy for the United States in this new era of Great Power Competition. The No Peer Rival framework is grounded in a realistic assessment of the most likely courses of action adopted by China, Russia, and other important regional powers. It prioritizes great power rivalry over other strategic goals, and identifies China as the biggest threat to America's unique position in the international system. This grand strategic approach carefully aligns the domestic sources of national power (economic strength, energy security, and technological prowess) to America's foreign policy and national security objectives. In addition to recommending necessary changes to America's military and diplomatic strategies, No Peer Rivals also demonstrates that a realistic approach to industrial policy, international trade, energy production, and technological superiority offers the best chance for developing the sinews of power needed to outcompete Beijing in the long run.";"Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2025.

289912;"The International Politics of Communication : Representing Community in a Globalizing World /";"Chong, Alan,";"""In an era of globalization, international communication constantly takes place across borders, defying sovereign control as it influences opinion. While diplomacy between states is the visible face of international relations, this ""informal diplomacy"" is usually less visible but no less powerful. Information politics can be found in propaganda, Internet politics, educational exchanges, tourism, and even popular film. The International Politics of Communication examines this informational dimension of international politics, investigating how information is generated, conveyed through channels, and directed specifically at audiences. While citizens are often portrayed as faithfully loyal supporters and beneficiaries of the modern nation-state-a fiction supported by passports, identification papers, and other notarized credentials-they are subject to the pulls of loyalty from transnational tribal affiliations, mythological and historical narratives of ethnicity, as well as the transcendental claims of religion and philosophy. Increasingly, social media also enchants non-state individuals, providing new virtual communities as the center of loyalties rather than national affiliations. By reinterpreting taken-for-granted concepts in journalism, media, political economy, nationalism, development, and propaganda as information politics, this book prepares serious-minded scholars, citizens, politicians, and social activists everywhere to understand the power plays in international communication and use alternatives to begin transforming power relations.""";"Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2025.

289910;"Troubled People, Troubled World : Psychotherapy, Ethics and Society /";"Briant, Michael,";"Ethical issues are the stuff of psychotherapy, and in fact Freud envisaged the process as one in which an unexamined, irrational and oppressive conscience gives way to one more benignly rooted in reason. Therapists endeavour to be non-judgemental and, indeed, are no more qualified to pass judgement on others than anyone else; do they nevertheless learn anything about ethics from their disciplined listening? The same question was asked after the war about the persecution of the Jews and other minorities, and it's a very live issue again, faced as we are by movements like ISIS, or Putinism in Russia, that cause great suffering in the name of religious or moral regeneration - a bewildering paradox that David Astor, former editor of The Observer called 'the scourge'.Can psychotherapy throw any light on it, or contribute any ideas as to how we might contain, if not prevent, the barbarism it sanctions? Can it offer any insights into a different, more inclusive kind of ethics, and if so, can we glean any guidance from it as to how we might further it?These are the questions the author explores, drawing on psychoanalytic thinking on these issues for over a century and illustrated by his work with individuals over four decades.";"Cambridge, UK : Open Book Publishers, 2025.

It addresses the scientific, social, and economic issues related to climate change, its potential impacts on the various ecosystems, adaptations, and management interventions for enhancing systems resilience in Southern Africa. It is written by numerous scientists from African states and Germany and summarizes the latest research findings, which are of great relevance for a better understanding of climate change impacts, adaptations, and vulnerabilities as well as for developing management options and policy options to reduce the associated risks. This is crucial considering that the projected African population increase is exceptional. Furthermore, climate change is assumed to hit southern Africa extremely hard with a significant increase in extreme events and the frequency of severe droughts, heat waves, and flooding. Southern Africa hosts a high variety of ecosystems, which belongs to important biodiversity hotspots for unique flora and fauna. The surrounding oceans form, in turn, a bottle neck within the ocean's global thermohaline circulation, act as a still poorly understood carbon sink and source and play an important role for fisheries as they are highly productive. Considering these important aspects, the book is an important interdisciplinary contribution to the scientific literature and will find a wide readership. The book is aimed at students, teachers, and scientists in the fields of terrestrial and marine ecology, environmental, nature and landscape planning, agriculture, environmental and resource management, biodiversity, and nature conservation, as well as scientists and representatives in specialised authorities and associations, nature conservationists, and policy makers of related disciplines";"Cham : Springer, 2024 ";"Part I.

290142;"Sustainability objectives in competition and intellectual property law / ";;"This open access volume of LIDC contributions focuses on how competition and intellectual property laws incorporate sustainability objectives. Businesses are increasingly embracing sustainability objectives, driven by the international community. Although competition and intellectual property law are certainly not the only tools for addressing sustainability issues, they can play a role in moving toward a more sustainable society. Sustainability has gained prominence in competition law in all jurisdictions covered in this volume. The contributions focus on classic questions such as whether sustainability agreements restrict competition and, if so, to what extent businesses can be exempted on efficiency grounds. The papers also raise a number of questions, in particular concerning the treatment of non-market efficiencies. The soft law and case law produced by competition authorities are examined, and the leadership role of some competition authorities in the field - from advocacy to policy papers and sustainability guidelines - is highlighted. The authors call for more individual guidance to provide enhanced transparency and clarity to industry, advisors and society at large on sustainability issues, with guidelines or sustainability-related block exemptions providing even greater legal certainty. With regard to intellectual property, the contributions examine various important issues, such as the need for intellectual property rights to remain technology-neutral, ways to promote the use of sustainable technologies and incentives for licensing, and ways to promote the dissemination of sustainable technologies, including compulsory licensing, cross-licensing, open source or FRAND licensing, and replacing the destruction of counterfeit goods with recycling.

These platforms serve as standards-based techno-economic systems that simultaneously capture cooperation through remote coordination and organize labor via algorithm management. Based on a three-years research project, this contributed volume outlines a general theory of platform capitalism that conceives these platforms not only as technical devices, but as generative engines that operate at the interface of several aspects, such as digitalization of forms of social cooperation; algorithm-based management of labor and participation; and private and vertical appropriation of profits. These elements are somehow iconic of the capitalist evolution of the last decades, and they open up a reflection on new forms of ""primitive accumulation"" (in particular regarding data), on the mechanisms used to capture and extract social surplus value, and on the logistic-financial dimensions of capital. Finally, in light of the transformations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors examine how platforms can evolve into hegemonic organizational structures. Assuming we are all already living in the age of the platform, this book takes a multifaceted approach -- combining sociology with urban studies, and political sciences with economics -- to grasp the challenges our societies face in terms of ensuring fair economic growth, adequate social protections, and labor rights.

290991;"Muslim mobilities : geographies of piety and belonging in Tajik Dubai business /";"Stephan, Manja,";"""A translocal ethnography about Tajik migrants' engagement in projects of reform Islamic life in Dubai, the book maps Gulf migration onto larger geographies of Muslim mobility, piety and belonging across places in Eurasia, the Gulf, and wider Middle East. Spatializing the intersection of migration, work and Muslim piety, the book examines how formations of ethical subjectivity are closely tied to the multiple places that shape migrants' travel itineraries and related experiences of dwelling there and crossing them. Situating these spatial biographies in broader transregional fields of Muslim mobility, connectedness and placemaking, the book explores why in the early 2000s young Tajik Muslims pursued spiritual, social and moral progress in the booming religious economy of Dubai's fur coat business sector. The book's spatial approach works threefold: With a focus on abroad, it interrogates the interplay of spatial perceptions of 'the good elsewhere' with migrants' placemaking 'there'. A second focus is on how multiplicity and flexibility of migrant situatedness (spatially, temporally, socially) in Persianate, Russophone and Arab culturescapes shape mobile pious subjectivities and cosmopolitan belongings. The book also develops a situated Tajik perspective on Gulf migration, that grounds in circulating spatial imaginaries, Muslim knowledge repertories, as well as in individual travel modes, paths and migrant experiences resulting from precarious livelihoods and discriminating migrant regimes. Linking anthropology with new area studies approaches, this book seeks to enhance multidisciplinary scholarship about the complex relation between religion, migration and mobile subjectivity in both Central Asian and Gulf studies and in the anthropology of Islam.""-- Provided by publisher";"Berlin ; Boston : De Gruyter, 2025 ";"Muslim mobilities -- Meaningful movements, meaningful places : the good elsewhere -- Kamak worlds : ""we do business, we're not migrants!"" -- Furs and piety in the 'evil paradise' -- Beyond work : making Dubai a Muslim place -- Housing, home, and the good Muslim life -- On temporality, flexibility, positionality, and connectivity.

The book applies Achille Mbembé's theorization of necropolitics to the environmental racism of the US War on Drugs in Colombia, specifically the aerial eradication of coca in the comunidades negras of the Pacific Coast. Through critical examination and deconstruction of transnational mythmaking and local oral tradition, Visions of Global Environmental Justice illustrates that non/humans rendered expendable by US-driven drug (necro)politics are indispensable to both the conceptualization and the realization of environmental justice globally. Far from being a study singularly focused on the symptoms of environmental issues, this book creatively guides us toward a broader conceptualization of environmental racism and justice across geographic scales and non/human agencies.";"Berkeley : University of California Press, 2025.

The book brings together a variety of design approaches on several scales developed in the collaboration of different agencies and within diverse contexts. Proximity prompts us to explore the challenges and opportunities for research in design, with the widening and closing of distances in unpredictable times such as those during Covid-19 pandemic. Despite the social distance imposed during this unprecedented global health scenario, researchers and professionals across different areas of knowledge have engaged in an extraordinary interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary global cooperation. This reinvented proximity enhanced the ability to cross fields, remove boundaries to collaboration between disciplines and accelerate processes towards an overarching goal: to overcome adversity. This edited collection reflects on what designers have taken from this experience so far, and the possibilities that are foreseen as the concept of Proximity is redefined. This book offers critical knowledge related to both design practice and design theory.

By adopting an innovative framework for analysis, the book challenges the constrained focus of much of the existing literature by explaining that the pathways to nuclear security for different actors across the globe will vary considerably in this new context. It argues that the Third Nuclear Age will be defined by friction and conflict between 'Nuclear Traditionalists', 'Technological Transformers', 'Hedgers and Balancers', and 'Activists and Protestors', as different interests and visions of the nuclear future clash.

At the intersection of hope and disillusionment, the diverse and thought-provoking chapters investigate emerging forms of activism in the Global South--including youth activisms, anti-racism struggles, feminist initiatives, online dissent, and Indigenous movements. In the 2020s, many parts of the world are witnessing contradictory processes of popular claims to rights, livelihoods, and social justice, and subsequent forms of populist authoritarianism and the securitization of civil society. Previously hopeful calls for dignity, democracy, and social justice--through protesting, strikes, civil society campaigns, legal reforms, and elections, for example--have been met with disdain and civic disengagement. This book investigates the re-imagination and pursuit of citizen activism in such times of popular disillusionment. It explores citizenship utopias as social imaginaries that are enacted and that articulate an ideal social order or democratic polity with ideal forms of experiencing citizenship. Its chapters interrogate conventional approaches to citizenship by introducing a nuanced and empirically grounded exploration of the complex ways in which people experience, negotiate, and engage in the societal changes that they aspire towards. The examination of citizenship utopias outlines contemporary signals for transformative futures and their possibilities. The book undertakes a fresh effort at contributing to the shifting terrain of critical development studies, political anthropology, political sociology, and decolonising scholarship by engaging in discussions about citizenship, activism, disillusionment, and future societal alternatives in times of multiple global challenges";"Oxford : Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2025.

291134;"Beyond International Intervention : Politics of Improvement in Serbia /";"Kusic, Katarina.";"Studies of statebuilding and peacebuilding have been criticized for their disregard of people living the consequences of intervention projects. Beyond International Intervention takes on the task of engaging with spaces and peoples not usually present in IR scholarship to rethink the very concept of ""intervention"" by paying close attention to how people actually experience and make sense of those efforts. In particular, the book offers a detailed engagement with ethnographic fieldwork in two policy areas in Serbia--agricultural policy and non-formal youth education. By engaging with subjects, the book not only enhances our understanding of intervention, but also uncovers the limitations of the concept. Katarina Kusić argues that the concept limits what we can observe and theorize, and it prevents researchers from engaging with the people living in spaces of intervention as coeval political subjects. As an alternative, she proposes to foreground improvement over ""intervention."" This reorientation enables researchers to trace hierarchies beyond the local/international dichotomy, expands fields of visibility beyond those prescribed by interventions themselves, and seriously considers the contradictions at the heart of liberalism.";"Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2025.

How can more housing be provided and, at the same time, the ecological goal of reducing land take be met? In many European countries, land-use planning is facing increasing and oftentimes contradictory challenges. This forms a land question, which requires land policies that can deal with the fraught relationship between planning and private property rights. A legislative reflex is to adapt planning laws. Oftentimes, such changes lack a deeper reflection of land policy and its implications. Especially an international comparison can foster a structured reflection of the own land policy. This thought-provoking book compiles a remarkable collection of 12 cases unveiling how land policies work. Curated by leading experts in the field, it takes the reader on a journey through the multifaceted realm of land policies across the continent. This book offers valuable insights into the complex interplay between land use, and property rights.

291137;"Towards Rethinking Politics, Policy and Polity in the Anthropocene : Multidisciplinary Perspectives /";"Brauch, Hans Günter.";"Humankind faces two anthropogenic threats to its survival that are closely linked. The first is the end of the Holocene and the start of the Anthropocene, which was marked by the test of a nuclear bomb on 16 July 1945. In the prevailing peace and security narrative, nuclear weapons and the 'other' (country, bloc or alliance) pose a perceived threat to humankind's survival. In the Anthropocene narrative, 'we are the threat' through our way of life and the burning of fossil fuels. The start of the Anthropocene coincides with a change in the international order with the setting up of the UN and the Bretton Woods Institutions. Three stages of this order are distinguished: the Cold War (bipolarity), the post-Cold War era (unipolarity), and the end of the rule-based global liberal order (multipolarity) on 24 February 2022. In this book ten multidisciplinary perspectives discuss complexity, Anthropocene geopolitics, peace and security discourses and the debate on the Anthropocene, planetary boundaries, complex crises and integrative geography in the Anthropocene, governance and politics, and the Patriacene and gender. Both existential threats for humankind are illustrated by cover photos of the first nuclear weapons test on 16 July 1945 and by Category 5 Hurricane Otis, an extreme weather event impacting on Acapulco in Mexico on 25 October 2023. The Anthropocene as a new epoch of Earth history coincides in 1945 with a change in the international order. In the security and peace narrative, the 'other' and nuclear weapons pose an existential threat; in the Anthropocene narrative. This dual existential change requires a rethinking of politics, policy and polity. In the social sciences, the Anthropocene is being discussed from multidisciplinary perspectives (geography, political science, and peace, security, and gender studies).

As a result of massive gains in scientific knowledge, made possible by statistical developments, data accumulation and computerisation over the last decades, more and more attention has been geared towards risks in the fields of public health and medicine. Specifically directed towards concrete experiences of health risks, the book analyses the social contexts in which these experiences occur to understand how people, in their diverse positions, actually think, feel, act, and interact around experiences of risk. The author argues that recurrent debates about risk exist because most of the time the notion leaves aside the complexity of social processes surrounding actual experiences and interpretations of vulnerability and danger in society. This book will be of interest to students and scholars of sociology of health and medicine and risk studies, as well as health professionals and policy-makers facing the complexity of acting and deciding in the risk society.";"Cham : Palgrave Macmillan, 2025.

This book is a collection of research on the relationships between people, their environment, their expertise and their languages along the ecologically fragile coasts of the Arabian Peninsula. These studies are the outcome of many years of collaborative fieldwork with local communities in three main regions of southern and eastern Arabia: the Musandam Peninsula, Dhofar and al-Mahrah, and the island of Soqotra. Bringing together oral literature, traditional scientific knowledge, and marine subsistence at the peripheries of the Arabian seaboard, the volume makes a major contribution to the documentation of the indigenous Modern South Arabian languages (MSAL), regional Arabic, and the Kumzari language, as well as to a greater understanding of their speakers' mastery in harvesting the seas. Diverse contributions by scholars and language community members explore the songs and stories, experiences and viewpoints of indigenous fishers, and shed light on the cultural significance of the maritime species encountered by each community.

Drawing on experiences in research, teaching, activism, and the creative arts, contributors explore what cultural analysis was back then, what it is now, and what it may be by 2034.

Drawing on her experiences as a destination lecturer on Caribbean cruise lines for twenty years, Anita Gonzalez offers a unique viewpoint as she examines contemporary Caribbean cruise culture as an ethnographically complex site where North American and European travelers are exposed to other cultures through the orchestrated experiences on ship, and via excursions to ports. Gonzales argues that the cruise ship experience is deliberately crafted to deliver the best immersive performance by its workers. However, the workers never leave the theater, they merely move below deck--and like ships' stewards and cooks from previous centuries, they work within an imaginary where Global Majority people are envisioned as servants. By utilizing ethnography and archival materials to illustrate ship workers' experiences on contemporary cruise ships, and then contrasting those circumstances with the personal accounts of workers on historical merchant ships, Shipping Out illuminates how workers' presence on ships complicates notions of freedom and enslavement, home and journey, place and space.";"Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2025.

It seeks to answer two questions: What kind of experience constituted premodern Islamic science? And in what ways did that experience constitute science? Answering these questions, the authors critique the trajectory of most existing histories of the period, which tend to reduce ""experience"" to empirical method or practice. This view reflects the emphasis that histories of modern science, especially of the Scientific Revolution, have placed on empiricism--the standard against which Islamic actors were then measured. This book offers a new historiography, arguing that experience had a far wider scope in the world of Islamic science. Combining an innovative theoretical framework with three case studies and a reflective epilogue by renowned experts in the field, this work offers the history of science a solid foundation on which to build its analyses of premodern science and the modality, scope, and role of experience therein. As a result, it speaks to specialists in the history of premodern Islamic science and historians of science in general to reconsider their historiographical assumptions.";"Cham : Springer, 2025.

291148;"Harvest Loss in China : rice, mechanization, and the moral hazard of outsourcing /";"Qu, Xue.";"This open access book examines food security in China with a specific focus on rice harvesting. As the most populous agricultural developing country, China's food security is closely related to the world's food security. An urgent issue internationally, data show that every year, about one-third of food is lost and wasted before it even reaches the market, mainly in less developed countries. To this end, halving the amount of food loss and waste is one of the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2021, the Chinese government issued the Anti-Food Waste Law of the People's Republic of China, placing a high priority on food loss reduction. Rice, one of the major staple foods, has also received a higher priority in government policy, as it has been deemed required to be ""absolutely safe"". In China, rice farmers rely heavily on outsourcing services to complete harvesting, which has led to the rapid development of mechanical harvesting. This book shows that the essence of outsourcing services is a principal-agent relationship in which there is a potential moral hazard, which is considered detrimental to harvest losses. The book analyses the effect of the moral hazard in harvest outsourcing services on rice harvest losses from this principal-agent theoretical perspective. Using the latest nationwide farmer survey, it empirically demonstrates the moral hazard in agricultural outsourcing services and its negative impact on harvest losses, providing suggestions for food loss reduction in China and similar developing countries where agricultural outsourcing services are developing rapidly. Relevant to social science researchers working in areas of food security in connection with the SDGs, and to scholars studying development in China more generally, this is a timely contribution confronting possible means of food loss reduction, in the developing world particularly, in the East, and globally.";"Singapore : Springer, 2025.

Featuring analytical and methodological approaches to the study of language and education, chapters range in context from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and address a range of issues such as the marginalisation of languages in education and policy, the interactions between language and social hierarchies in the South Asian context, and technology's impact on language education, acquisition, usage and preservation. Ultimately initiating dialogue on the need for positive changes in language, education research and policy, this book will appeal to scholars, researchers and postgraduate students in the fields of language education, international and comparative education, and education and technology. Policymakers in international development and sociolinguistics may also find the volume of use.

Zammit /";"Frendo, Anthony J.";"This Festschrift, Arabic in Context, is a tribute to the remarkable scholarly legacy of the Reverend Professor Martin R. Zammit. It celebrates his extensive contributions to the fields of Semitic Studies, Arabic linguistics, and comparative Semitic philology. Spanning decades of dedicated research and teaching, Professor Zammit's career has been marked by a profound engagement with the Arabic language and its diverse dialects, as well as its historical and cultural intersections with Maltese and Syriac.The volume features a carefully curated collection of essays authored by distinguished scholars, reflecting the breadth and depth of Professor Zammit's academic interests. Topics range from Arabic dialectology and phonetics to linguistic contact phenomena and the grammaticalisation processes in Semitic languages. Contributions explore the linguistic heritage of Central Asia, the Judeo-Arabic traditions of Libya and Syria, and the influences of Arabic on Maltese toponymy and idiomatic expressions. Together, these studies exemplify the rich interdisciplinarity and intellectual rigour that characterise Professor Zammit's work.This Festschrift not only honours Professor Zammit's enduring scholarly impact but also serves as a vital resource for linguists, philologists, and researchers in the fields of Arabic and Semitic studies. It stands as a testament to his dedication to fostering academic inquiry and dialogue, inspiring both colleagues and students alike.

Thanks to the latest photographic technologies, we can now take photos in computer games, interpolate them in extended reality platforms, or synthesize them via artificial intelligence. To account for the most recent shifts in conceptualizations of photography, this book proposes the term virtual photography as a binding theoretical framework, defined as a photography that retains the efficiency and function of real photography (made with or without a camera) while manifesting these in an unfamiliar or noncustomary form.";"Bielefeld : transcript Verlag, 2025.

291160;"The World's Constitution : Spheres of Liberty in the Future Global Order /";"Webb, Adam Kempton,";"Global governance is tightening and foreshadows world state formation becoming a live political issue in this century. Some observers treat it as inevitable amid the urgency of global issues. They foresee a technocratic scaling up of the model of state authority that has prevailed at the national level for over two hundred years. Many critics and members of the public around the world look askance at that prospect. They rightly fear a moral vacuum of authority disconnected from the world's traditions, and a concentration of power that would be damaging to liberty or even dystopian in its upshot. Still, they often merely aim to stand athwart the scaling up of political institutions, rather than actively trying to shape an alternative that can seize the global horizon. The World's Constitution: Spheres of Liberty in the Future Global Order offers a radically different vision of future world order that could work in a global space while shifting the balance of power from state back to society. It draws on older resources in political thought, both Western and non-Western, to upend mainstream notions of statehood and sovereignty that have been taken for granted for too long in the modern era. It offers an original 'sphere pluralist' framework that can reconcile liberty, tradition, and cosmopolitanism. As a book rooted in the past but mindful of future constitutional and policy challenges, it bridges ideas and real world implications, with insights that cut across a wide range of topics from migration and social welfare to personal law systems and channels of representation. It opens an exciting debate about global constitutional futures that is likely to become more salient over the next couple of generations";"New York, NY : Routledge, 2025.

Humans have always moved, but across the world 'migration' has become a major policy, political and media concern. How can we understand human movement without positioning 'the migrant' as a problem? This interdisciplinary collection rethinks migration and movement. It explores mobility beyond the human and across time, from the movement of soil in the Middle Ages to contemporary cow passports. It also examines the histories of international borders and how they are intertwined with the politics of race and nation. The book illustrates that conceptually based, critical and creative thinking is as important for practice as it is for theory and can help us understand and respond to migration as a force that connects rather than divides.";"Bristol : Bristol University Press, 2025.

It describes the ecosystem of education and its features, impacts, and the factors that facilitate or inhibit its current shape and development, including the pendulum of internationalization versus localization of education and indigenous knowledge. The book serves as an arena to engage vital discourse on the importance of early childhood education and inclusive education systems, particularly for those with diverse abilities. In view of the transformations occurring in the education systems in the Gulf Region over the past few decades, the book examines the advancement of education in Qatar and the critical political, economic, and cultural influences shaping education development plans, reforms, and policies. The book identifies the key factors and barriers that continue to hinder governmental initiatives in the region, in terms of the need to elevate the quality of key fields. The authors unpack the requirements imposed on policymakers in the broader Gulf region and pinpoint the need for Qatar to adopt more sustainable and state-of-the-art education policies, programs, and tools, to ameliorate the quality of education. In doing so, the book draws an all-inclusive portrayal of education in the country and its links to human and economic development. It identifies the transformations required to adapt to changing conditions, particularly within a dynamic and increasingly competitive job market. Bringing together academics and experts in public policy, education, development, and related social sciences in the Arabian Gulf, this book contributes to co-creating innovative and multidisciplinary solutions within higher education, relevant to both students and scholars in these respective fields.";"Singapore : Springer, 2025.

However, communities directly impacted by the dehumanizing legacies have insisted on a broader reckoning--one that recognizes all dimensions of the harms, including the spiritual injury and the relevant psychosocial trauma inflicted across the generations. They remind us that harms of structural injustice extend beyond the material, the physical and the psychological, also entangling the moral, relational, and spiritual fabric of human life. Understanding harms of inhumanity brings to light the layers of damage and is key to identifying interdisciplinary approaches to collective healing, social transformation and the well-being of all. This book emerges from the ongoing intellectual dialogue as part of the UNESCO Collective Healing Initiative. The Initiative focuses on healing the wounds of inhumanity, co-creating just societies and enhancing the flourishing of current and future generations.";"Berlin/Boston : Walter de Gruyter GmbH, 2025.

Leading scholars from the fields of future studies, planning, geography, history, sociology, design, and the humanities sensitize for the intricate role of geography in building knowledge to anticipate probable, to imagine alternative, and to enact desirable futures. Part I, knowing the future, explores strategies for anticipating possible futures, such as foresight methods, scenarios, and guiding images. This section underscores the importance of cultivating future consciousness to confront societal denial of looming threats like environmental crises. Part II, envisioning the future, delves into various ways societies imagine their futures, exploring topics like the future of food, post-growth economies, extra-terrestrial futures, and even human self-extinction to reveal how futurist scenarios can inform decision making and proactive planning. Part III, enacting the future, focuses on the performative aspects of futuring. The authors in this section examine practices--such as designing, performing, advising, and governing--that are aimed at transforming desired futures into present realities. As part of a series on the interdisciplinary nexus between knowledge and space, this book is an essential resource for researchers, policy makers, planners, students, and practitioners in the fields of sustainability, future studies, regional development, and governance.";"Cham : Springer, 2025.

291346;"Handbook of Families in the Arab Gulf States / ";"Rahman, Mizanur,";"This open access book collates and advances the body of knowledge about the factors, directions, and magnitudes of change in Arabian Gulf families from interdisciplinary perspectives. Family life across the globe is being impacted by unprecedented diversity in household living arrangements and by sweeping economic, cultural, and social change, and this is not an exception in the Gulf region. The book demarcates how Gulf families are experiencing many formidable challenges and undergoing profound changes due to speedy economic transformation, educational reforms, extensive use of social media, rapid urbanization, migration, women empowerment, and the intersections of popular culture from both the East and the West. Notwithstanding such challenges and changes, Gulf families often seem to retain and continue many of the traditional roles and functions of families in a sustained manner. It contributes to current debates that revolve around questions of what has changed, and what has stayed the same, in family structures in the region. Sweeping and comparative, the book provides avenues for offering practical solutions for policy interventions in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and Saudi Arabia. It is a key academic text for sociologists interested in transformations in the family in relation to politics, economics, consumption patterns, education, gender, law, social media, religion, culture, social reforms, and the state.";"Singapore : Springer, 2025.

It further outlines a top-level design and implementation blueprint global based on CELM to achieve global carbon neutrality. For the first time, the CELM mechanism effectively addresses the three fundamental questions regarding carbon emissions: who should be liable for carbon emission, how much liability, and how to offset it. The introduction of CELM may unveil a feasible third path towards global carbon neutrality, and effectively address  numerous challenges of carbon tax and Emission Trading System. CELM facilitates the creation of an efficient, cost-effective and comprehensive societal carbon footprint database, and addresses issues related to international carbon border regulation mechanism. While the world is struggling to tackcle the imminent climate crisis, CELM offers a refreshing global carbon neutrality solution, with its characteristics of more fair, more efficient, and less expensive, bringing new alternative options for the international community.";"Singapore : Springer, 2025.

291264;"An unwritten future : realism and uncertainty in world politics /";"Kirshner, Jonathan,";"An argument for the classical realist approach to world politics An Unwritten Future offers a fresh reassessment of classical realism, an enduring approach to understanding crucial events in the international political arena. Jonathan Kirshner identifies the fundamental flaws of classical realism's would-be successors and shows how this older, more nuanced and sophisticated method for studying world politics better explains the formative events of the past. Kirshner also reveals how this approach is ideally equipped to comprehend the vital questions of the present--such as the implications of China's rise, the ways that social and economic change alter the balance of power and the nature of international conflict, and the consequences of the end of the US-led postwar order for the future of world politics. Laying out realism's core principles, Kirshner discusses the contributions of the perspective's key thinkers, including Thucydides, Hans Morgenthau, and Raymond Aron, among others. He illustrates how a classical realist approach gives new insights into major upheavals of the twentieth century, such as Britain's appeasement of Nazi Germany and America's ruinous involvement in Vietnam. Kirshner also addresses realism's limits and explores contemporary issues, including the ascent of great power challengers, the political implications of globalization, and the diffusion of power in modern world politics. A reexamination of the realist tradition, with a renewed emphasis on the crucial roles played by uncertainty, contingency, and contestation, An Unwritten Future demonstrates how a once-popular school of thought provides invaluable insights into pressing real-world problems.";"Princeton ; Oxford : Princeton University Press, 2022 ";"Introduction and Overview -- Chapter 1.

291265;"The development of an art history in the UAE : an art not made to be understood /";"Kazan Makhlouf, Sophie,";"This book draws together an oral and visual art history of a country that is extremely rich in culture and history but that is often overlooked or underestimated. By observing the country's history and visual culture and the artistic practices of select artists from the UAE, it considers the development of contemporary art from the UAE. This will increase accessibility to art by Emiratis and underline its wider relevance. There is a dearth of literature on contemporary art by Emiratis, and this may be one of the reasons contemporary art from the UAE is under-represented globally. In order to help the reader better understand art from the UAE, this book traces the country's historical make-up, its culture and contemporary art tradition through oral histories based on interviews with a wide variety of artists and people working in the art industries. It also explores this development using global art discourses that are relevant to art produced in the UAE today. This book also considers how cultural and artistic identities are formed and explores the political and socio-economic interests in the country that have stimulated art practices and appreciation. For so long, an exclusively Western narrative has dominated Art, and popular media portrays the Gulf's accomplishments in development and modernity with suspicion.

Our lives are in countless ways defined by our citizenship. The country we belong to affects our rights, our travel possibilities, and ultimately our chances in life. Obtaining a new citizenship is rarely easy. But for those with the means--billionaires like Peter Thiel and Jho Low, but also countless unknown multimillionaires--it's just a question of price. More than a dozen countries, many of them small islands in the Mediterranean, Caribbean, and South Pacific, sell citizenship to 50,000 people annually. Through six years of fieldwork on four continents, Kristin Surak discovered how the initially dubious sale of passports has transformed into a full-blown citizenship industry that thrives on global inequalities. Some ""investor citizens"" hope to parlay their new passport into visa-free travel--or use it as a stepping stone to residence in countries like the United States. Other buyers take out a new citizenship as an insurance policy or to escape state control at home. Almost none, though, intend to move to their selected country and live among their new compatriots, whose relationship with these global elites is complex. A groundbreaking study of a contentious practice that has become popular among the nouveaux riches, The Golden Passport takes readers from the details of the application process to the geopolitical hydraulics of the citizenship industry. It's a business that thrives on uncertainty and imbalances of power between big, globalized economies and tiny states desperate for investment. In between are the fascinating stories of buyers, brokers, and sellers, all ready to profit from the citizenship trade.";"Cambridge, Massachusetts : Harvard University Press, 2023 ";"Selling Citizenship --A Product Is Born --EU Citizenship --New Developments around the Core Market --Geopolitical Maneuvering --The Citizenship Industry --Do the Programs Pay Off? --""Is My Citizenship Really Worth That Much to Someone?"" --Who Wants to Buy a Passport? --Citizenship in the Twenty-First Century.

291269;"Pax Economica : Left-Wing visions of a free trade world /";"Palen, Marc-William,";"The forgotten history of the liberal radicals, socialist internationalists, feminists, and Christians who envisioned free trade as the necessary prerequisite for anti-imperialism and peace Today, free trade is often associated with right-wing free marketeers. In Pax Economica, historian Marc-William Palen shows that free trade and globalisation in fact have roots in nineteenth-century left-wing politics. In this counterhistory of an idea, Palen explores how, beginning in the 1840s, left-wing globalists became the leaders of the peace and anti-imperialist movements of their age. By the early twentieth century, an unlikely alliance of liberal radicals, socialist internationalists, feminists, and Christians envisioned free trade as essential for a prosperous and peaceful world order. Of course, this vision was at odds with the era's strong predilections for nationalism, protectionism, geopolitical conflict, and colonial expansion. Palen reveals how, for some of its most radical left-wing adherents, free trade represented a hard-nosed critique of imperialism, militarism, and war. Palen shows that the anti-imperial component of free trade was a phenomenon that came to encompass the political left wing within the British, American, Spanish, German, Dutch, Belgian, Italian, Russian, French, and Japanese empires. The left-wing vision of a ""pax economica"" evolved to include supranational regulation to maintain a peaceful free-trading system--which paved the way for a more liberal economic order after World War II and such institutions as the United Nations, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization. Palen's findings upend how we think about globalisation, free trade, anti-imperialism, and peace. Rediscovering the left-wing history of globalism offers timely lessons for our own era of economic nationalism and geopolitical conflict.";"Princeton, New Jersey : Princeton University Press, 2024 ";"Introduction -- The Imperialism of Economic Nationalism: Globalizing the American System of Protectionism -- The Anti-Imperialism of Free Trade: The Liberal Radical Critique of Imperialism and War -- Marx and Manchester: The Pacifistic Evolution of the Socialist Internationalist Free-Trade Tradition -- The International Feminist Fight for Free Trade, Anti-Imperialism, and Peace -- Free Trade, Fraternity, and Federation: The Economic Cosmopolitanism of Christian Pacifism -- Pax Economica vs. Pax Americana: The Left-wing Free-Trade Fight Against Neocolonialism, Neomercantilism, and Neoliberalism, 1945-2022.

The roots of these contestations lie in the different ways the Gulf has been defined as a region, both by those who live there and those beyond its shore. Making Space for the Gulf reveals how capitalism, empire-building, geopolitics, and urbanism have each shaped understandings of the region over the last two centuries. Here, the Gulf comes into view as a created space, encompassing dynamic social relations and competing interests. Arang Keshavarzian writes a new history of the region that places Iran, Iraq, and the Arabian Peninsula together within global processes. He connects moments more often treated as ruptures—the discovery of oil, the Iranian Revolution, the rise and decline of British empire, the emergence of American power—and crafts a narrative populated by a diverse range of people—migrants and ruling families, pearl-divers and star architects, striking taxi drivers and dethroned rulers, protectors of British India and stewards of globalized American universities. Tacking across geographic scales, Keshavarzian reveals how the Gulf has been globalized through transnational relations, regionalized as a geopolitical category, and cleaved along national divisions and social inequalities. When understood as a process, not an object, the Persian Gulf reveals much about how regions and the world have been made in modern times. Making Space for the Gulf offers a fresh understanding of this globally consequential place.";"Stanford, California : Stanford University Press, 2024 ";"Introduction.

It offers case studies and policy-relevant ideas for conflict-affected areas to move forward in a more sustainable manner. Following the Arab Spring revolutions, civil wars have plagued the Middle East and North Africa region, along with other countries in Africa. The task of rebuilding peace and institutionalizing stability in conflict-affected countries or fragile states emerging from conflict is a daunting, uncertain, and context-specific task. Yet, focusing on understanding conflicts in the Middle East and Africa offers an important view of the role of non-state actors during conflicts. These regions feature the highest numbers of inter- and intra-state conflicts, and the governments are more often contested than in the rest of the world. The volume proposes different cases addressing the fundamental challenge of inclusion and cohesion of nonstate actors during conflicts.

Presenting doctrinal and historical insights, the book not only considers the different types of hybrid threats, but also how they are increasingly showing that traditional understandings of security risk are becoming obsolete. Bringing together leading experts in the fields of security, anthropology, and EU law, chapters map out the EU and NATO's responses to five hybrid threats: disinformation, instrumentalisation of migration, cyberthreats, abuses of energy resources, and lawfare. The book focuses on both security and legal issues and answers two interrelated questions: what is the nature of a hybrid threat? And what legal tools are available to the EU to protect its citizens from those threats? The answers to these questions reveal how hybrid threats put increased tension on the capacity of a democratic system to resist rival models. Interdisciplinary in scope, this will be a fundamental resource for researchers, academics and students of European law, terrorism and security law, politics, and international relations.

Identifying important questions including: Does the entrepreneur have a strong vision? Can the person execute successfully? and how will he or she recover if the business encounters setbacks?

However, can there be purely defensive or moral wars? This book offers unique insights into twenty-first century warfare through three approaches - Realism, Militarism, and Just war Theory - in the context of 'precision' weapons, celebrated for minimising risks to soldiers and civilians. The author questions whether the rapidly developing technology of lethal autonomous weapons is actually expanding an existing legal-ethical issue: the problem of civilian harm. Laws permits acts that cause incidental civilian harm; AI warfare puts the law's accountability gap into sharper relief, highlighting the need for new accountability mechanisms that reflect a sense of legal and moral justice.";"Cardiff, England : University of Wales Press, 2024 ";"‘Rules-based Orders’ by Dr Barry J.

It conceives of responsibility in a comprehensive way, tackling the legal responsibility, liability and accountability of state and non-state actors for harm they cause to the environment. Responsibility for Environmental Damage traverses the primary and secondary rules of international law, the responsibility, liability and accountability of states, international organizations, corporations and individuals, as well as existing, new and emerging regulatory frameworks. It engages with the consequences of environmental harm, appraising both orthodox legal doctrines and cutting-edge questions like shared responsibility, equitable considerations, full reparation, response measures under liability regimes, corporate responsibility, ecocide and responsibility for climate change, amongst many others. In doing so, the book evaluates whether the law is equipped to deal with the novel challenges that environmental damage presents and argues that new legal tools are needed to effectively tackle some of the most significant threats to our planet. This book is an essential resource for undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as scholars who conduct research on responsibility, liability or accountability for environmental damage in the areas of public international law, international environmental law, human rights, international criminal law and international economic law. International law practitioners, judges, arbitrators, policymakers, and those working for think-tanks and NGOs will similarly benefit from this valuable work.";"Cheltenham : Edward Elgar Publishing, 2024 ";"1.

At the heart of this book is a simple but critical question - what do UN mediators tasked with the responsibility to make peace actually do? By explaining this, the book offers a detailed record of what Kofi Annan, Lakhdar Brahimi, and Staffan de Mistura did in their roles as UN mediators in Syria and presents a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics that shaped their decision-making. Beyond the cases of these three mediators, Fadi Nicholas Nassar introduces a method by which to forensically identify a mediator's fingerprints on the peacemaking process and charts a map to examine their decision-making processes. In doing so, it paves the way to evaluate the performance of these mediators - to hold them accountable for their successes and failures.";"Cambridge, England : Cambridge University Press, 2024 ";"1 Introduction: Dispelling the Fog of Peacemaking -- 2 The Global Statesman -- 3 The Quiet Negotiator -- 4 The Televised Humanitarian -- 5 Conclusion: The Fingerprints They Leave Behind  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291287

Balancing empirical research with legal theory, the author dissects recent case studies, tracing individual changes in norms against a background of systemic transformation. Arms Transfers to Non-State Actors follows changes in the prohibition of arms transfers to non-state actors since the pivotal International Court of Justice's Nicaragua ruling in 1986. Hannah Kiel critically discusses the legal developments through relevant case studies, including Abkhazia, Bosnia, Congo, Eastern Ukraine, Kosovo, Libya, Northern Iraq, South Ossetia, Syria and Yemen. Adopting a customary law perspective while also placing the narratives of states in the context of international structural changes, Kiel emphasises the interplay between state practice and the strengthening of a human rights-based paradigm. Kiel ultimately shows that changes in norms at the individual level indicate a larger transformation in the international order, and while the arming of non-state actors remains formally illegal, the prohibition of this practice is informally eroding. Interdisciplinary in scope, this book provides valuable insights for scholars and researchers of public international law, human rights, international humanitarian law, and international relations. It is also of great benefit to human rights lawyers, policymakers, and diplomats.";"Cheltenham, England : Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2024 ";"1.

Matti Vartiainen explores this shift in working culture and what it means for staff wellbeing and performance, as well as how remote work policies can be implemented effectively. This book assesses the flexibility paradigm which hybrid work hinges on, surveying the elements of hybrid work and how it has been addressed in national policy debates in Europe and telework literature overall. Examining the potential hindrances and challenges of hybrid working as well as the benefits and opportunities that it creates, the book presents important findings on the current implementation of this style of work. Finally, Vartiainen looks to the future of hybrid work, and ultimately argues that combining basic work elements and life spaces with trust-based leadership styles will generate functional organisational solutions for diverse purposes, aims, and contexts. Studying past remote and telework experiences to inform future research and policy development, this book will prove a valuable read to organisational researchers, consultants and human resource practitioners.

Digital transformation of businesses, cities, manufacturing sector, service sector, government offices and procedures, vehicles (Internet enabled vehicles), and Industry 4.0 are taking place at a distinguished pace and have many rewards. Digital transformation helps to address many social, techno-financial, and governance issues, but it also carries many challenges like increased volume of cyber-attacks, privacy concerns, security threats, digital identity threat, phishing frauds, operational security, and many other vulnerabilities. Aforesaid challenges have become a common phenomenon in today's interconnected world. It is the time when cyber-security must be stationed as a central issue and be established as a management issue besides a technological issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation. Work from home (remote working) and learn from home (online learning) are the new normal of life. The repercussions set by the COVID-19 pandemic will outlast the post-pandemic era. AI can help human society to resolve modern issues of cyber security. AI can be used by organizations to mitigate risks and increase revenue by detecting cyber threats and fraud at an early stage. Although keeping up with new viruses and malware updates is becoming more difficult, cyber security using artificial intelligence technologies will facilitate the detection and response to threats and malware by using previous cyber-attack data to determine the best course of action. AI may often be better and more effective than humans in detecting malicious malware. The faster the data breach was identified and contained, the lower the costs.

The book adds new aspects to the extensive literature on grand strategies in the Middle East by exploring and evaluating competing strategies from an ""insider"" perspective. First, it highlights the main determinants of Global powers' grand strategies, assesses the ones applied in the Middle East, and forecasts future strategies after the Ukraine war in alignment with other rival states' capabilities and goals. It then underlines regional dynamics and the hegemonic quest of regional powers and their power politics' determinants since the ""War on terror,"" the Arab Spring, and, more recently, the Russian intervention in Ukraine and Israel-Gaza conflict. The book broadens readers' perspectives by clarifying the region's dynamics that shaped the global and regional power rivalries, where security concerns, economic interests, oil supplies, and hegemonic ambitions make it complicated for the US to keep influence and the total control it had during the late 20th century.

291291;"Pluralizing humanism : religions and secularisms beyond power /";"Jakelic, Slavica,";"Humanism is appealed to today whenever we want to tackle the conditions of dehumanization in the contemporary world. But for humanism to be viable in the twenty first century, this book argues, it needs to be pluralized. Employing theoretical, historical, and sociological arguments, this book moves beyond the discourse of critique. It engages theories of religion and secularism, as well as postmodern, postcolonial, and decolonial critiques of Western humanist projects, to uncover the ideas and practices of religious and secular humanisms when they challenge dehumanization in the pursuit of conditions of flourishing for all. Through studies of the Solidarity movement in Poland and the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, the book demonstrates the centrality of humanist traditions to the emergence of religious-secular solidarities that transformed the political landscapes of the world. By highlighting the instances in which humanisms functioned as checks on each other's absolutist claims, the book contends that humanisms supply a constructive path for addressing the challenges of our time--a time of radically divided societies and intolerant, even violent, forms of nationalism. A challenge to the critiques of humanism that seek to identify it solely as the legacy of the West, as anti-religious discourse, or relegate it to the domain of power constellations, Pluralizing Humanism highlights the rich plurality of humanist discourses and the need for their mutual engagements. It points to humanist ideals as constitutive of politics that can guide our human power because they are irreducible to it. As such, this book will appeal to social scientists, social theorists, religious studies scholars, and ethicists with interests in religion, secularism, social movements, and humanist thought and practice.";"Abingdon, England ; New York, New York : Routledge, 2025 ";"Introduction: From Humanism to Humanisms -- 1 The Powers of Religions and the Challenge of Pluralism -- 2 The Ethics of Secularisms and the Problem of Pluralism -- 3 Pluralizing Humanism: Particular, Not Parochial -- 4 Identity, Dignity, and Dialogue: The Humanist Ethos of Polish Solidarity -- 5 From Resistance to Freedom: Humanisms and the Imagining of a New South Africa -- Conclusion: Humanizing Politics, Sustaining Democracies -- Index  ";https://library.ecssr.ae/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=291291

In the opening decades of the twenty-first century the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership under Xi Jinping has created a worldwide Sino-centric network, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), to challenge American dominance in world affairs. Encompassing economic, financial, political, and strategic relations, the CCP's belief is that the funds, construction projects, and promises offered by the BRI will generate a widespread perception of the inexorability, legitimacy, and thus acceptability of a Chinese world order. Consisting initially of a land-based ""Silk Road Economic Belt,"" an oceangoing ""Maritime Silk Road,"" and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the BRI has expanded to involve more than 140 countries and includes a Health Silk Road, Digital Silk Road, and Polar Silk Road, but it has also experienced serious challenges.

291297;"Sustainability : transformation, governance, ethics, law /";"Ekardt, Felix,";"This book proposes a holistic transdisciplinary approach to sustainability as a subject of social sciences. At the same time, this approach shows new ways, as perspectives of philosophy, political science, law, economics, sociology, cultural studies and others are here no longer regarded separately. Instead, integrated perspectives on the key issues are carved out: Perspectives on conditions of transformation to sustainability, on key instruments and the normative questions. This allows for a concise answer to urgent and controversial questions such as the following: Is the EU an environmental pioneer? Is it possible to achieve sustainability by purely technical means? If not: will that mean to end of the growth society? How to deal with the follow-up problems? How will societal change be successful? Are political power and capitalism the main barriers to sustainability? What is the role of emotions and conceptions of normality in the transformation process? To which degree are rebound and shifting effects the reason why sustainability politics fail? How much climate protection can be claimed ethically and legally e.g. on grounds of human rights? And what is freedom? Despite all rhetoric, the weak transition in energy, climate, agriculture and conservation serves as key example in this book. It is shown how the Paris Agreement is weak with regard to details and at the same time overrules the growth society by means of a radical 1,5-1,8 degrees temperature limit. It is shown how emissions trading must - and can - be reformed radically. It is shown why CSR, education, cooperation and happiness research are overrated. And we will see what an integrated politics on climate, biodiversity, nitrogen and soil might look like.

Most organizations view data monetization--converting data into money--too narrowly: as merely selling data sets. But data monetization is a core business activity for both commercial and noncommercial organizations, and, within organizations, it's critical to have wide-ranging support for this pursuit. In Data Is Everybody's Business, the authors offer a clear and engaging way for people across the entire organization to understand data monetization and make it happen. The authors identify three viable ways to convert data into money--improving work with data, wrapping products with data, and selling information offerings--and explain when to pursue each and how to succeed.

291299;"Hacking hybrid media : power and practice in an age of manipulation /";"Barnard, Stephen R.,";"
The contemporary public sphere is rife with problematic information, but on what terms are manipulators able to garner attention in the hybrid media system? In Hacking Hybrid Media, Stephen R. Barnard examines how networked media capital is changing the fields of politics and journalism. With a focus on the messaging strategies employed by Donald Trump and his most vocal online supporters, Barnard provides a theoretically oriented and empirically grounded analysis of the ways today's media afford deceptive political communication. Analyzing data from prominent political events, Barnard shows how members of Trump's ""digital army"" use Facebook groups, Reddit forums, Twitter hashtags, YouTube channels, mass media, and more to shape the flow of disinformation in American media.From the structures of social media platforms to the practices of political actors, Barnard offers a critical appraisal of media power and the capital required to wield it. He reflects not only on the tools and techniques of manipulative media campaigns, but also on the implications they hold for the future of journalism, politics, and democracy in the US and beyond. In striking a balance between social theory and empirical research, Hacking Hybrid Media shows how the emergent structures and practices of the contemporary media system shape how information flows, how meaning is made, and ultimately, how networked social influence works.

291442;"The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Defence / ";"Taddeo, Mariarosaria,";"The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for national defence poses important ethical problems that combine ethical risks related to the use of AI--e.g. enabling human wrongdoing; reducing human control; removing human responsibility; devaluing human skills; and eroding human self-determination--with those that follow the use of force in warfare, like respecting of human dignity and the risk of breaching the principles of Just War Theory. Because of the range of possible applications and of the set of ethical risks and opportunities to address, it is difficult to develop a coherent and systemic ethical analysis of AI in defence. The goal of this chapter is to clarify how this book will do so, by outlining the methodology and the scope of the analysis proposed here.

Focusing on the principles of sustainability, circularity and inclusivity, it illustrates how these trends form the breeding ground for a new economy embodying a logic of collectiveness. Expert contributors highlight six specific global developments that are contributing to societal transition: digitalization, circularity, the bio-based economy, sharing, self-production, and the internet of things and services. They demonstrate how these trends question the foundations and social contracts underlying the current linear economy. They identify a new generation of business models based on key features including intra-organisational collaboration, transparency, and high-level coordination to ensure economic developments contribute to a fair society. Through an analysis of how these trends may develop going forward, they provide innovative recommendations for strategy and policy development alongside a conceptual toolbox for realising the economy of the future.

Addressing key challenges hindering the harmony between investment law and sustainable development, the book unveils a new methodology to assess whether a government measure or foreign investment contributes to sustainable development. The primary question driving this text is: how should investment treaty arbitration tribunals evaluate the sustainable development impact of both government measures and foreign investments affected by those measures? Beginning by establishing a conceptual framework around the right to regulate for public interest, the book also identifies limitations in the typical approach taken in investment treaty arbitration. Additionally, broader systemic constraints within international investment law concerning sustainable development are discussed.

The author analyses how capitalism prevents climate transition, assessing in detail why the climate cause is not more widely embraced by the working classes, when they are infinitely less responsible and suffer far more from the effects of environmental degradation than their wealthier counterparts. He argues that, faced with the supporters of green capitalism, who promise us that we will be able to continue current lifestyles unhindered - thanks to new technologies - the left seems disarmed. Globally, we face an immense challenge: in the span of one generation, we must decarbonise our planet by 2050. We must make huge changes - but a successful transition could bring huge benefits. This book tackles the root cause of the problem: inequalities and the hyper-concentration of wealth, which are driving forces behind the continued increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the loss of biodiversity. Denouncing the liberal mythologies of ""green growth"" and ""decoupling"", the author frames climate justice as an authentic social struggle, uniting the underclasses of the world, and arguing for the need to develop essential communal services, to put an end to insecurity and protect the planet. The intention is that a full life and sustainable environment are no longer the privilege of a few but the reality of all. This book will appeal to students and scholars of political science and environment and sustainability - as well as all those concerned with climate justice and the current ecological crisis.";"Abingdon, England ; New York, New York : Routledge, [2025].

But will they continue to do so in the future? None of the major challenges that confront humanity today - from climate change to disease, from terrorism to mass migration - can be handled effectively by single nation-states, no matter how powerful. The world is no longer made up only of states but also of an ever-increasing multitude of interstate networks and organizations which recognize no borders. We are beginning to be able to imagine the very real possibility of a new global civil society. But what political form should this take? By examining the history of the evolution of human society from the world's first empires to today's world of interstate networks, this book argues that there now exists the possibility of the emergence of a new political form, a global 'federation of federations', that will bring the species closer to the possibility of a more harmonious, equitable and secure future.

Gathering insights from leading scholars and practitioners, it examines the actors involved in cyberwarfare, their objectives and strategies, and scrutinises the impact of cyberwarfare in a world dependent on connectivity. The Research Handbook on Cyberwarfare interrogates cyberwarfare as a form of military intelligence statecraft that seeks to exploit digital systems for operational and strategic advantage. Chapter authors address cyberwarfare in its conceptual, historical, operational and strategic dimensions, and explore the application of international law, norms, ethics and arms control to this area of conflict. They pose crucial questions about the utility of cyberwarfare and its effects on society and citizens, establishing foundations for future research on the topic as a fact of international life. Providing rich detail in an accessible and understandable manner, this Research Handbook is a vital resource for scholars and researchers of cyber conflict, international relations, and security studies.

Spanning the late 1970s to the present, it examines various projects, methods, strategies, contents, driving forces, and limitations of legislative reform, administrative reform, judicial reform, and reform of the legal profession. Legal reform in these countries is the project of the political elite to improve the legal system while retaining its core socialist principles. It is carried out through legislative enactments, amendments, and replacements, which the political elite adopt using incremental strategies to reform the legal system sporadically or systematically. Socialist legal reform is animated by the political aspiration to create the rule of law, the impact of social-economic change, and the influence of transnational and comparative law. Despite significant reforms, the socialist principles of the legal systems in these countries largely remain intact. This legal reform, however, varies considerably by country.

After humans settled across the planet, growing empires began to compete for resources. First, they competed for wood, then steel and coal. The ability to mine these resources and turn them into trains, ships, and weapons decided which countries would dominate the world. Oil became the most important international resource by the turn of the 20th century and has remained so until the present day. This book provides a comprehensive history of international conflicts over energy resources, including ancient empires, 20th-century wars over oil, and the explosive growth of renewable energy. This volume demonstrates that humans have the technology to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy for the vast majority of their energy needs, despite corporate fossil fuel interests.

It explores how universities can adapt to the rapid change, and challenges, of the job market brought by digital and green transitions. Specifically, it investigates the profound impact of the digital revolution on higher education institutions, including the integration of disciplines, changing student demands, as well as new job requests from firms and institutions on the market. Entrepreneurship and Digital Humanities identifies how universities can respond to these issues. The book highlights the need for a progressive consolidation between technical and soft skills, knowledge of digital tools, and ethical considerations in order to prepare students for the jobs of the future. Adopting a cross-disciplinary perspective, expert contributors argue that to fulfil their civic role, modern universities must develop a new humanism, placing the enhancement of human potential at its core.

291306;"Leadership as stewardship : honouring our past while ensuring our future /";"Iszatt-White, Marian,";"Exploring different understandings of stewardship across a range of research domains and cultures, this insightful book examines the tensions between competing perspectives and their implications for leadership. Marian Iszatt-White proposes 'leadership-as-stewardship' as a new signifier for leadership research, providing practical guidance to leaders navigating the challenges and trade-offs of the Anthropocene. Leadership as Stewardship identifies how the apparent inadequacy of modern leadership coincides with a shift in scholarship away from practical inquiry and towards a range of aspirational approaches, including authentic, sustainable, responsible and ethical. Iszatt-White proposes stewardship as an alternative to these aspirational forms of leadership and challenges the ability of Western, Enlightenment-based thinking to solve global issues created by that same thinking. The book concludes that it is time to place the more enact-able construct of stewardship at the heart of leadership aspirations and scholarly activities. Interdisciplinary in scope, this book will be vital for scholars of leadership, management and organization studies. Highlighting the ability of stewardship to combat perceived failings in leadership as both a construct and a practice, it is also valuable to policymakers, management educators and leadership practitioners.";"Cheltenham, England : Edward Elgar Publishing Limited, 2024 ";"1.

The latter aspect is less explored than the predominant focus on Islamist opposition movements. The book analyses how these Islamist political parties navigate and negotiate with oppositional forces and establishments, concisely discussing the complex dynamics at play within each country.

291468;"Green and sustainable finance : principles and practice in banking, investment and insurance /";"Thompson, Simon,";"The finance sector has a crucial role to play in delivering a sustainable future for the planet. Finance plays a key role in addressing the Triple Planetary Crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss, and it is vital that the finance sector rapidly accelerates the mobilization of capital to support a successful and just global transition to net zero. This requires enhancing both the capabilities of financial institutions and developing the knowledge and skills of finance professionals to the point where every professional financial decision takes account of climate change and sustainability.

291466;"United Nations Peacekeeping and the Politics of Authoritarianism / ";"Von Billerbeck, Sarah,";"Why do countries hosting UN peacekeeping operations tend to consolidate authoritarian forms of governance, despite the UN's own stated aim of promoting democratization? This book advances a theoretically innovative and empirically rich answer to this question: while the UN does not intentionally promote authoritarianism, it faces a number of constraints and dilemmas that give rise to what we call authoritarian enabling. Enabling can occur through two mechanisms, capacity building and the creation of a permissive environment, which enhance the ability of host governments to engage in authoritarian behavior and signal to them that doing so is low-cost. We illustrate these two mechanisms with four in-depth case studies of UN peacekeeping operations: UNTAC in Cambodia, Monuc/Monusco in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Minustah in Haiti, and UNMIL in Liberia. While enabling stops short of the outright promotion of authoritarianism, it explains why the UN's activities often appear to contradict its stated objectives and the outcomes it delivers fall short of its goals. In addition to its theoretical and empirical contributions, the book suggests how these dilemmas and challenges can be overcome";"Oxford, England : Oxford University Press, [2025] ";"Table Of Contents -- Cover -- Title Page -- Copyright Page -- Acknowledgments -- Contents -- List of Figures -- List of Abbreviations -- 1 Introduction -- Peacekeeping Operations and the Domestic Politics of Host States -- Argument in Brief: A Theory of Authoritarian Enabling -- Why Read This Book -- Research Design -- Overview of the Book -- 2 UN Peacekeeping, Democracy, and Authoritarianism -- Introduction -- The Emergence of a UN Democracy Agenda -- The Application of the Democracy Agenda in UN Peacekeeping -- The Effects of Peacekeeping on Regime Type -- Peacekeeping and Authoritarian Enabling -- The Sources of Authoritarian Enabling -- Conclusion -- 3 Acquiesce for Success: UNTAC in Cambodia -- Introduction -- The Cambodian Conflict and the Road to UNTAC -- UNTAC and the Politics of Enabling -- Signaling a Permissive Environment: UNTAC and Electoral Malpractice -- Signaling a Permissive Environment: Post-Election Power Sharing -- Conclusion -- 4 Don't Rock the Boat—the Devil You Know Is in It: MONUC/MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- Introduction -- The Congo Wars and the Road to MONUC/MONUSCO -- MONUC/MONUSCO and the Politics of Enabling -- Building Capacity: Political Institutions -- Building Capacity: Security Institutions -- Signaling a Permissive Environment -- Conclusion -- 5 Do as We Say, Not as We Do: MINUSTAH in Haiti -- Introduction -- Conflict in Haiti and the Road to MINUSTAH -- MINUSTAH and the Politics of Enabling -- Building Capacity: Security Institutions -- Signaling a Permissive Environment -- Conclusion -- 6 How Do You Criticize a Global Superstar?

291465;"The Oxford Handbook of International Political Economy / ";"Pevehouse, Jon C.,";"The field of International Political Economy (IPE) has rapidly developed into a central pillar in the study of International Relations, and its interdisciplinary roots make it a rich and productive area of scholarly interest. This Oxford Handbook analyses and evaluates the state of the art in IPE research. Bringing together leading experts from a wide geographical and theoretical spectrum, the Handbook provides accessible and comprehensive surveys on topics central to the study of International Political Economy. As IPE scholarship evolves to explore global events such as financial crises and trade wars, examining how politics is both a cause and a consequence of economics, it highlights the practical and problem-driven nature of the field. The Handbook considers the purported European-North American divide and the impact of the surrounding debate on the approach taken to the field. The chapters review the scholarly literature, outline future research opportunities, and consider the ways in which world events have contributed to new research in the field. The Handbook covers both the theoretical and methodological foundations of the field as well as substantive topics within it, including regulation, foreign aid, migration, NGOs, capital, political-military relations, and many others.The Oxford Handbooks of International Relations is a twelve-volume set of reference books offering authoritative and innovative engagements with the principal sub-fields of International Relations.The series as a whole is under the General Editorship of Christian Reus-Smit of the University of Melbourne and Duncan Snidal of the University of Oxford, with each volume edited by specialists in the field. The series both surveys the broad terrain of International Relations scholarship and reshapes it, pushing each sub-field in challenging new directions. Following the example of Reus-Smit and Snidal's original Oxford Handbook of International Relations, each volume is organized around a strong central thematic by scholars drawn from different perspectives, reading its sub-field in an entirely new way, and pushing scholarship in challenging new directions.";"Oxford, England : Oxford University Press, [2025] ";"Table Of Contents -- Cover -- Half Title -- Series -- THE OXFORD HANDBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY -- Copyright -- Contents -- List of Contributors -- 1.

Microchips in our vaccines, stolen elections, climate change denial--in the face of a bewildering range of misbeliefs that stem from mistrust of informational sources, exposure to misinformation and disinformation, and partisan polarization, it's easy to dismiss those who disagree with us as ""delusional"", ""psychotic"", or merely ""ignorant"". But what if none of these judgments are supported by how we really come to believe things, and the truth is that we are all prone to false beliefs? What can we do to protect ourselves in this post-truth world? Drawing on decades of experience as a psychiatrist and clinical professor, Joe Pierre invites readers to journey with him through the normal quirks of brain functioning--such as ""heuristics"", cognitive biases, motivated reasoning, cognitive dissonance, and bullshit receptivity--that create the cognitive vulnerabilities to false belief innate within us all. With a cross-disciplinary approach, False illuminates the psychology of false belief that lies at the root of contemporary media mistrust, science denialism, and political polarization, and highlights that contrary to popular opinion, deficits of intelligence and mental health are usually not to blame. With a refreshingly unbiased lens, Pierre suggests an antidote to false beliefs and makes the case for softening our convictions, viewing our ideological opponents with compassion, and mending the rifts in our relationships as individuals and societies alike.";"New York, NY : Oxford University Press, [2025] ";"Delusions, distortions, and misbeliefs, oh my! -- The psychology of overconfidence -- Confirmation bias on steroids -- The flea market of opinion -- The disinformation industrial complex -- Conspiracy theories gone wild -- Falling for bullshit -- Divided states -- We are not our beliefs -- A prescription for a post-truth world.

In Political Automation, Eduardo Albrecht explores this question in various domains, including policing, national security, and international peacekeeping. Drawing upon interviews with rights activists, Albrecht examines popular attempts to interact with this novel form of algorithmic governance so far. He then proposes the idea of a Third House, a virtual chamber that legislates exclusively on AI in government decision-making and is based on principles of direct democracy, unlike existing upper and lower houses that are representative.

291484;"Statecraft 2.0 : what America needs to survive in a multipolar world /";"Ross, Dennis,";"In a world that is multipolar and America has less relative power, the United States no longer has the luxury to practice statecraft badly. The United States may still be the world's strongest country, but it now faces real challenges at both a global and regional level. The unipolar world which was dominated by America after the Cold War is gone. Unlike the Soviet Union, China is both a military and economic competitor and it is actively challenging the norms and institutions that the US used to shape an international order during and after the Cold War. Directly and indirectly, it has partners trying to undo the American-dominated order, with Russia seeking to extinguish Ukraine, and Iran trying to undermine American presence, influence, and any set of rules for the Middle East that it does not dominate. The failures of American policy in Afghanistan and Iraq have weakened the domestic consensus for a US leadership role internationally. Traditions in US foreign policy, especially the American sense of exceptionalism, have at different points justified both withdrawal and international activism. Iraq and Afghanistan fed the instinct to withdraw and to end the ""forever wars."" But the folly of these US interventions did not necessarily mean that all use of force to back diplomacy or specific political ends was wrong; rather it meant in these cases, the Bush Administration failed in the most basic task of good statecraft: namely, marrying objectives and means. Nothing more clearly defines effective statecraft than identifying well-considered goals and then knowing how to use all the tools of statecraft--diplomatic, economic, military, intelligence, information, cyber, scientific, education--to achieve them. But all too often American presidents have adopted goals that were poorly defined and not thought through. In Statecraft 2.0, Dennis Ross explains why failing to marry objectives and means has happened so often in American foreign policy. He uses historical examples to illustrate the factors that account for this, including political pressures, weak understanding of the countries where the US has intervened, changing objectives before achieving those that have been established, relying too much on ourselves and too little on allies and partners. To be fair, there have not only been failures, there have been successes as well. Ross uses case studies to look more closely at the circumstances in which Administrations have succeeded and failed in marrying objectives and means. He distills the lessons from good cases of statecraft--German unification in NATO, the first Gulf War, the surge in Iraq 2007-8--and bad cases of statecraft--going to war in Iraq 2003, and the Obama policy toward Syria. Based on those lessons, he develops a framework for applying today a statecraft approach to our policy toward China, Iran, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The book concludes with how a smart statecraft approach would shape policy toward the new national security challenges of climate, pandemics, and cyber.";"New York, NY : Oxford University Press, [2025] ";"Statecraft in a world of disorder -- Statecraft, its meaning, and why it is often done poorly -- America's self-image, traditions, and role in the world -- Different schools of thought about America's role in the world -- German unification in NATO -- Bosnia -- Undoing Iraqi aggression in Kuwait -- George W.

Bob Hancké, Toon Van Overbeke and Dustin Voss offer a historical and thematic review of the evolution of political-economic thought, centred on the relation between capitalism and democracy. Chapters discuss how interests, ideas and institutions are the methodological and conceptual building blocks of political economy. The authors use these concepts to understand how markets work and why they fail, the problems facing the welfare state, the political economy of voting and democracy, and the problems of cooperation in a world of interdependent democracies. Covering the main analytical approaches that political economists have developed to tackle the complexities of this social world, the book expands on some of the most important questions confronting the field.

By examining how successive US administrations since 9/11 have deployed drones in pursuant of different typologies of US grand strategic objectives, the book probes the putative political and strategic goals drones supposedly advance, and the impact of its continued proliferation for US for international security. The book provides a powerful base of evidence for policy makers and researchers by pointing to the perils of deployment of drone technology beyond their immediate or short-term objectives. It also explores how non-state actors and authoritarian regimes such as armed groups are harnessing armed drone technologies for their own political and military ends, as well as the underlying implications for US grand strategy and international security at large.";"Cham : Springer International Publishing AG, 2023.

In Landing the Paris Climate Agreement, Todd Stern, the chief US negotiator on climate change, provides an engaging account from inside the rooms where it happened: the full, charged, seven-year story of how the Paris Agreement came to be, following an arc from Copenhagen, to Durban, to the secret U.S.-China climate deal in 2014, to Paris itself. With a storyteller's gift for character, suspense, and detail, Stern crafts a high-stakes narrative that illuminates the strategy, policy, politics, and diplomacy that made Paris possible. Introducing readers to a vivid cast of characters, including Xie Zhenhua, Vice Minister of China's National Development and Reform Commission, Bo Lidegaard, chief strategist for Denmark's Prime Minster, and Indian minister Jairam Ramesh, Stern, who worked alongside President Barack Obama and Secretaries of State John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, depicts the pitfalls and challenges overcome, the shifting alliances, the last-minute maneuvering, and the ultimate historic success. The book concludes with a final chapter that describes key developments since 2015 and the author's reflections on what needs to be done going forward to contain the climate threat. A unique peek behind the curtain of one of the most important international agreements of our time, Landing the Paris Climate Agreement is a vital and fascinating read for anyone who cares about the future of our one shared home.

291507;"Cyberdemocracy : Transforming Politics /";"Karem, Harem, | author.";"This book is explicitly modernist at a time when many scholars have either forgotten the emancipatory promise of the Enlightenment or railed against it in the name of postmodernism. The book, broadly, adopts a hybrid epistemology that utilises the critical insights of Geisteswissenschaften Tradition (Weberian 'Ideal-Type Analysis') and the Habermas (1988) notions of the 'public sphere' and deliberative/dialogic democracy ('ideal speech') to advance a general proposition of democratic renewal by way of cyberdemocracy. Curiously, as democracy spreads across the world in the age of globalisation, it has also been accompanied by increased discontent with democratic systems. To that end, this book is not overly concerned with saving democracy beyond the liberal representative model, rather the focus is on how modern representative democracy has failed and how cyberdemocracy might function as a more effective model that truly represents the people by broadening participation and reflexivedeliberation.";"Cham : Springer International Publishing AG, 2023.

Bloom introduces a ground breaking theory of 'complex power', where control itself becomes a central driver of capitalism, shaping economies and societies. Bloom explores how this insatiable demand for security and profit extends beyond traditional authoritarian regimes, permeating everyday life and eroding democratic freedoms.

It addresses cutting- edge issues such as cyberwars, self-defence, intergenerational trauma, gender fluidity, racism and state surveillance. Throughout, the book underscores the need to respect the agency and dignity of children and youth, to build cultures of juvenile rights, and to think critically of the place of the child amid global power politics and decolonisation.

Visit www.luminosoa.org to learn more. Concerns regarding brain injury in sport have escalated into what is often termed a ""concussion crisis,"" fueled by high-profile lawsuits and deaths. Although athletes are central figures in this narrative, they comprise only a small proportion of the people who experience brain injuries, while other high-risk groups--including victims of domestic violence and police brutality--are all too often left out of the story. In Violent Impacts, Kathryn Henne and Matt Ventresca examine what is and what isn't captured in popular discourse, scrutinizing how law, science, and social inequalities shape depictions and understandings of brain injury. Drawing on research carried out in Australia, Canada, and the United States, they illustrate how structural violence centers certain bodies as part of the concussion crisis while pushing others to the margins.";"Berkeley : University of California Press, 2025.

292021;"From Kosovo to Darfur : The Regional Biases Within Humanitarian Military Interventionism /";"Kushi, Sidita,";"Why are some violent crises more likely to prompt humanitarian military interventions than others? Conventional wisdom says that humanitarian military interventions occur due to national interests, shared values and norms, or economic benefits for the interveners. Yet neither of these factors can fully explain the selectivity of such interventions. The international community continues to ignore the decades-long suffering in Darfur, often dismisses the genocidal policies within Myanmar, and even perpetuates the suffering in contemporary Yemen, while undertaking humanitarian-laden missions in Libya, Syria, and the Balkans. Using in-depth case studies and new data on all post-Cold War internal armed conflicts matched to third-party responses, From Kosovo to Darfur offers the first regionally sensitive analysis of humanitarian military intervention since the end of the Cold War. It shows that international military interventions in the context of acute humanitarian crises are driven by different pathways within the Western versus the non-Western world and fueled by elite perceptions of the crisis, making interventions closer to the geographic and cultural West most probable and most intense. As our international community becomes increasingly interdependent and aware of human suffering across borders, From Kosovo to Darfur points to new pathways of conflict trajectories and reveals vital implications for leaders, scholars, and nongovernmental actors advocating for or against international military intervention as a policy choice.";"Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2025.

At a conservative estimate, there are at least 100 million adults across the globe who are affected by their relatives' addiction problems. These Affected Family Members (AFMs) experience multiple stresses, coping dilemmas, and a lack of information and support, and are at heightened risk for ill-health. The results are very costly, both from the personal and from the public services point of view. The volume elaborates on the barriers to providing effective help, including political neglect, under-representation in both policy and service delivery models, the lack of involvement and encouragement from health and social care professionals, the stigmatisation and bias as barriers to care, and the range of evidence-based interventions. It also explores the similarities and differences of all of these areas depending on the type of addiction problem that the family is affected by - alcohol, illicit drugs, gambling, etc. While covering the more commonly reported work in high-income countries, the contributions put strong emphasis on the experience of AFMs in low- and middle-income countries.

292015;"Fear the Future : Dystopia and Political Imagination in the Twentieth Century /";"Cole, Matthew Benjamin,";"After centuries of contemplating utopias, late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century writers began to warn of dystopian futures. Yet these fears extended beyond the canonical texts of dystopian fiction into postwar discourses on totalitarianism, mass society, and technology, as well as subsequent political theories of freedom and domination. Fear the Future demonstrates the centrality of dystopian thinking to twentieth century political thought, showing the pervasiveness of dystopian images, themes, and anxieties. Offering a novel reading of major themes and thinkers, Fear the Future explores visions of the future from literary figures such as Yevgeny Zamyatin, Aldous Huxley, and George Orwell; political theorists such as Max Weber, Hannah Arendt, Herbert Marcuse, Jürgen Habermas, and Michel Foucault; and mid-century social scientists such as Erich Fromm, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, David Reisman, C. Wright Mills, and Jacques Ellul. It offers a comparative analysis of distinct intellectual and literary traditions, including modern utopianism and anti-utopianism, midcentury social science, Frankfurt School critical theory, and continental political philosophy. With detailed case studies of key thinkers from the Enlightenment to the late twentieth century, the book synthesizes secondary literature and research from a range of disciplinary areas, including in political theory, intellectual history, literary studies, and utopian studies. This wide-ranging reconstruction shows that while dystopian thinking has illustrated the dangers of domination and dehumanization, it has also illuminated new possibilities for freedom.";"Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2025.

The increasing prevalence of digital information presents opportunities and challenges for analyzing language, with cultural, geographic, and contextual factors shaping how content is portrayed. Despite the interdisciplinary nature of media bias research across fields like linguistics, psychology, and computer science, existing work often tackles the problem from limited perspectives, lacking comprehensive frameworks and reliable datasets. The book aims to advance the field by addressing these gaps and proposing a systematic approach to media bias detection. It develops feature-based and deep-learning approaches for automated bias detection, including a BERT-based model and MAGPIE, a multi-task learning model. These methods demonstrate improved performance on established benchmarks, showcasing the potential of deep learning in detecting media bias. Finally, the author addresses the practical applications of automated bias detection, such as enhancing news reading with forewarning messages, text annotations, and political classifiers, and examines the impact of bias on social media engagement.";"Wiesbaden : Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, 2025.

292013;"Brain Fingerprint Identification / ";"Kong, Wanzeng,";"This open access book delves into the emerging field of biometric identification using brainwave patterns. Specifically, this book presents recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG)-based biometric recognition to identify unique neural signatures that can be used for secure authentication and identification Traditional biometric systems such as fingerprints, iris scans, and face recognition have become integral to security and identification. However, these methods are increasingly vulnerable to spoofing and other forms of attack. Unlike other traditional biometrics, EEG signals are non-invasive, continuous authentication, liveness detection, and resistance to coercion due to the complexity and uniqueness of brain patterns. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for high-security fields such as military and finance, providing a promising alternative for future high-security identification and authentication However, most of the existing brain fingerprint identification studies require subjects to perform specific cognitive tasks, which limits the popularization and application of brain fingerprint identification in practical scenarios. Additionally, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and time-varying characteristics of EEG signals, there are distribution differences in EEG data across sessions from several days, leading to stability issues in brain fingerprint features extracted at different sessions. Finally, because the EEG signal is affected by the coupling of multiple factors and the nervous system has continuous spontaneous variability, which makes it difficult for the brain fingerprint identification model to be suitable for the scenarios of unseen sessions and cognitive tasks, and there is the problem of insufficient model generalization. In this book, based on traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods, the authors will carry out multi-task single-session, single-task multi-session, and multi-task multi-session brain fingerprint identification research respectively for the above problems, to provide an effective solution for the application of brain fingerprint identification in practical scenarios.";"Singapore : Springer, 2025.

292011;"Handbook of Diversity Competence : European Perspectives /";;"This open access handbook provides the most current overview of the discussion on diversity competence, with a focus on Europe. Diversity competence has become a key area of interdisciplinary study because of the increasingly intercultural nature of institutions and organisations across the world. This important handbook reviews the conceptual and theoretical foundations of this concept and reflects on the scope of its application. It provides directions for further research in the theory, research and practice of diversity competence and includes country-wise perspectives as well. An international team of researchers brings together insights from research and best practice in psychology, cultural sciences, economics, pedagogical sciences, sociology, social work, medicine, theology, politics and law. This is an important resource for a wide readership of students, researchers and practitioners who research on or work with people from diverse cultures.";"Cham : Springer, 2025.

292009;"Coral Conservation : Global Evidence for the Effects of Actions /";"Thornton, Ann,";"Coral Conservation: Global evidence for the effects of actions provides an essential resource for anyone dedicated to conserving or restoring corals. This comprehensive synthesis of global scientific evidence examines the effectiveness of conservation and restoration actions targeting stony, soft and cold-water coral species inhabiting a diverse range of marine habitats in tropical, temperate and arctic waters from shallow coasts to the deep sea. Addressing the urgent threats posed by climate change, invasive species, overfishing, and habitat destruction, this work summarizes evidence from actions in three core themes: protecting healthy reefs, mitigating human impacts, and undertaking active restoration. From establishing Marine Protected Areas to innovative techniques like coral gardening, the synopsis summarizes the evidence for practical actions and offers insights into their outcomes and applicability.Designed to guide decision-makers--resource managers, conservationists, policymakers, and local advocates--as well as those curious to learn about actions that could help corals, this accessible guide provides succinct information to support evidence-based conservation. By identifying the existing evidence and highlighting gaps in the knowledge, Coral Conservation can support practitioners and policymakers to allocate resources effectively by prioritising actions that work. By doing more of what works, we can reverse the loss of coral species and restore these vital habitats for the benefit of current and future generations.The authors consulted an international group of coral experts and conservationists to produce this synopsis. Funding was provided by A.G. Leventis Foundation and Oceankind. Coral Conservation is the 25th publication in the Conservation Evidence Series Synopses, and is freely available from the online Conservation Evidence database (www.conservationevidence.com) ensuring that users have ongoing access to updated research and assessments.

It outlines new operational strategies, incorporating an analysis of technological development trends focused on the well-being and health of older adults, identifying their needs and expectations through participatory processes, and establishing design requirements to foster the acceptance of interfaces and emerging devices. In light of the exponential increase in smart applications within living environments, the book emphasizes the necessity to introduce cutting-edge solutions for data transmission and processing, as well as the development of semantically driven tools to support designers in selecting and integrating assistive technologies through virtual environment simulations. The book also illustrates the methodological processes adopted in defining guidelines for the design of spaces dedicated to older adults, with attention to architectural and functional aspects in various domains: perceptual and sensory factors for the design of waiting areas in Community Houses, technological and environmental requirements for the integration of devices in home adaptation projects for Home Care and locational and typological criteria for the development of new Social Day Care Centers.

While the range of methodological discussions regarding research-and-practice collaborations between scientific researchers and local practitioners (based in NGOs, private firms or local government agencies) as well as independent policy-makers or artists for the purpose of urban sustainability has been thriving vastly over the last years, little attention has been paid to spatial methods in particular. This is not to mention their transdisciplinary use in urban contexts of the Global South. Resorting on empirical settings as diverse as Pretoria (South Africa), Porto Alegre and São Paulo (Brazil), Kolkata (India), Bangkok (Thailand) and Tshwane (South Africa) during the last four (partially Covid-19 pandemic) years as well as Tangerang (Indonesia) from 2001 to 2021, and San José (Costa Rica) between 2004 and 2007, the book sheds light on the following, twofold question: Which possibilities and limitations can spatial methods respectively unravel and encounter for transdisciplinary research and practice, in view of the SDG11 targets? By pursuing very diversified research-and-practice paths with the aid of specific combinations of spatial methods, each of the eight chapters makes evident the book's central claim: the deployment of spatial methods in transdisciplinary projects for SDG11 has a transformative role.

Central in these complexities is the position of the human individual, who is both an actor and reactor in global events. This textbook introduces three I's - interests, identities, ideas - that provide a framework to understand human behaviour in today's world. The role of people is further elaborated in the three spatial dimensions of the local, regional, and global level. This gives International Studies the character of a 3-D chessboard with human players. Unique in this textbook is the framework of global scopes used for analysis of the global complexities: global structures (such as economics, belief systems, states, intergovernmental organizations), global trends (such as nationalism, power changes, secularization, identity), and global challenges (such as sustainable development, climate change, pandemics, unwanted migration). This textbook approaches International Studies as a field of study that enables students to navigate the framework of the three I's, the three spatial dimensions and the three global scopes. The International Studies student will acquire a broad overview of the various fields and disciplines and, as a consequence, the ability to move across traditional academic boundaries.";"Amsterdam : Amsterdam University Press, 2025.

Through both historical and contemporary examples, the book elaborates the concrete possibilities for reimagining politics and society that emerge out of the clash between incompatible legal and economic structures. At its core, Tomba's book confronts the very foundations of the modern state and its three pillars: property, democracy, and citizenship. These pillars, long celebrated in the Western canon, are nevertheless mechanisms of exclusion: property is the denial of communal access, representative democracy the marginalization of the demos from decision-making, and citizenship the exclusion of the foreigner. Revolution and Restoration critiques these pillars to show how new concepts and political possibilities that emerge from political and social conflicts hold the potential to transcend and remake democracies in crisis.

292482;"The Politics of Beginning : The Origin of Private Authority in the Process of Translation /";"Esguerra, Alejandro.";"The Politics of Beginning traces the formation of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), now the most authoritative private organization for forestry certification. It starts with recounting the highly politicized forest politics of the late 1980s, when activists protested human rights abuses and deforestation while experimenting with sustainable forestry practices. The book then follows the people who became the founding members of the Forest Stewardship Council. By using live audio recordings of the FSC founding assembly in 1993, this book provides an in-depth analysis of a constitutional moment for private authority in world politics. To explore how timber merchants, Indigenous communities, and social and environmental NGOs engaged in private institution-making, Alejandro Esguerra works with the concept of translation developed in Actor-Network Theory--a process in which knowledge about governance is continuously recontextualized--and introduces it to International Relations theory. He develops a dramaturgical methodology with metaphors of theatre such as stage, script, and performance. This methodology can be used to analyze the ways in which activists and others translate knowledge about governance and the practices of inclusion and exclusion that appear during this process. The environmental crisis requires a transformation in the ways societies value and govern human-nature relations, and The Politics of Beginning reveals the conditions under which even formerly antagonistic actors start developing a common political project.";"Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2025.

292483;"Publishing Beyond the Market : Open Access, Care, and the Commons /";"Moore, Samuel A.";"Publishing Beyond the Market argues that the move to open access should focus less on the free accessibility of research outputs and more on who controls the publications and infrastructures for scholarly communication. By deploying theoretical literature on science and technology studies, care ethics, and the commons, the book critically interrogates open access and reimagines a more ethical future for researcher-led publishing. A case study of Plan S--the multifunder European policy for open access publishing--explores its tendency to rehearse all the failures of commercialisation. Through critical engagement with the open access landscape, the book reveals the shortcomings of market-centric and policy-based approaches to open access book and journal publishing, particularly their tendency to reinforce conservatism, commercialism, and private control of publishing. Going forward, Publishing Beyond the Market explores the importance of collectivity and democratic governance within the transition to open access publishing. It suggests that developing a commons-based, scholar-led publishing landscape through a series of presses that are each managed by working academics could offer a productive counterpoint to marketised systems of open access and subscription publishing. In weaving themselves together in order to ""scale small"" these publishing initiatives would act as a counter-hegemonic project based on mutual reliance and care. By illustrating how these projects build toward a commons-based publishing future, and how they may complement other approaches to publishing within university presses and libraries, the book culminates in an argument for the infrastructures, policies, and forms of governance needed to nurture such a collective vision.";"Ann Arbor : University of Michigan Press, 2025.

ESG scoring and ratings are used to estimate ESG risk.This book presents ESG ratings and scorings and their providers and lists problems with data quality, data sources, and unknown methodology, contributing to the green- and social-washing ESG rating phenomenon. The value of assets invested in green instruments relies on high-quality ESG ratings to measure green transition. Data greenwashing negatively impacts the financial market, especially the stock price, fund activities, and bond markets. The size of the rated company, geographical location, and industry biases are considered in understanding the greenwashing phenomenon. This book illustrates all the problems related to ESG rating inflation, conflicts of interest, models of payment, and internal and external ratings. It describes current regulations, initiatives, and practical knowledge of ESG scoring.Academics and students of financial law, economics, and financial sustainability will find this book invaluable. The practical implications in the book will benefit sustainability-concerned regulators and practitioners who estimate ESG risk (especially in financial institutions).";"Oxford : Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2025.

This book highlights the principles, methods and systems in place to regulate peaceful relations between states, and the implications the war in Ukraine has had on their relevance in the changing geopolitical world.Bringing together leading experts on international law, including key Ukrainian voices, the book explores the strengths and weaknesses in international law which have been exposed by Russia's invasion. The UN has stated that the war has catastrophic effects for international security and human rights. The book explores these statements, drawing on varied aspects of international law to determine lessons to be learned from the Ukraine conflict. It also explores how international law has had to adapt to tackle the challenges which have arisen. The book asks, has the conflict challenged the theory and fundamental values of international law? Have there been any new legal developments, prompted by the war, which could be applied to future conflicts? Through these timely questions, the book re-evaluates the changing landscape of international law.The book will be of interest to students and scholars in the fields of international law, the use of force, humanitarian law, criminal law, refugee law and human rights law.";"Oxford : Taylor &amp; Francis Group, 2025.

292486;"Recycling Institutions : How Waste Becomes an Urban Mine /";"Nogueira, Letícia Antunes.";"This open access book investigates the phenomenon of recycling institutions in urban mining using social sciences lenses on the empirical context of waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), landfills as a potential resource pool and the recycling of building materials in Norway.There is a dual meaning to the term 'recycling institutions', and this book has the ambition to explore both. The first refers to institutions that recycle, i.e., the institutional infrastructure that facilitates material recycling. From household attitudes and practices to the laws and regulations that govern waste management, there is an institutional apparatus that recycling relies upon, which gains increased importance as the sustainability agenda develops. The second meaning refers to the recycling of institutions, in the sense that the institutional setup itself is being repurposed and transformed. This more metaphorical meaning points to the way in which emerging societal ambitions (such as the circular economy) stretch and bend existing institutions by imposing new functions upon them. Institutions are conservative and backward-looking and tend to resist rapid and radical changes that are incompatible with the ideas and practices they are built on. So, whereas the first is about designing new institutions for circularity, the second is about modifying and ""recycling"" existing institutions to meet the challenges circularity may entail.The central premise is that relevant, supportive and well-functioning institutional environments are crucial in the transition to a greener society that encourages industries, businesses, households and citizens to act in more sustainable ways, and it identify both possibilities and obstacles in the emergence of institutions that support urban mining. This book integrates a range of disciplines in the social sciences to investigate the phenomenon of recycling institutions. By examining the case of urban mining in Norway, with a special focus on how existing structures developed for waste management can be repurposed to facilitate this new function, the book provides insight into a scenario where material sourcing from anthropogenic sources is dissociated from natural resource scarcity and is instead linked to political ambitions and an attempt to stay at the forefront of sustainability transitions.";"Cham : Springer, 2025.

292487;"Climate Change : A Geoscience Perspective /";"St. John, Kristen.";"This open access book on climate change assesses past climatic change from a geoscience perspective and directly and effectively addresses common misconceptions on climate and climate change.A geoscience perspective on the multiple causes, rates, and consequences of climate change is essential context to assess modern climate change and our role in it, as well as forecasting future climate conditions. Yet, most textbooks on climate change focus only on the very recent past (e.g., last century), are not sufficiently engaging for non-scientists, or explore paleoclimate science at a level too challenging for introductory students. In addition, a wide range of misconceptions and confusion exists in the general public about climate change. Correcting misconceptions is an essential aspect of education, but educational research has shown that it is challenging to achieve. This textbook includes introductions to each thematic Part, that directly identify relevant misconceptions and refute them with clear, concise messages (i.e., learning goals) that are grounded in science and expanded on in the supporting chapters. Such refutation-style approaches have been shown to be effective at addressing misconceptions.The book offers a clear trajectory of fundamental climate science concepts, which are most beneficially combined to provide a valuable geoscience perspective on the causes, rates, and consequences of climate change. It frames the collection of climate science chapters with impactful, relevant social science context: starting the book with a chapter that explores the reasons behind the disconnect between the scientific and public understanding of climate change, and ending the book with a discussion of the intersection of ethics and climate change. Short topical expansions or excursions are included as ""boxes"" within selected chapters.This book will serve as a basic resource for learning about the lessons that the paleoclimate record offers to evaluate the seriousness of modern and future climate change.";"Cham : Springer, 2025.
